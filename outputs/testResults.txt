<legal_opinion> This case involves a prime contractor reviewing a contract and determining which clauses to flow down to a subcontractor. The main legal issue is identifying the specific clauses that must be flowed down to subcontractors based on the FAR.

Analysis:

The FAR Subpart 44.4, Subcontracts for Commercial Products and Commercial Services, outlines the specific clauses that must be flowed down to subcontractors for commercial products and services.

The contract in question is for supplies and services, and it is not explicitly stated that the products or services are commercial. However, the contract does include a clause for "Professional Employee Compensation Plan" (PECP), which suggests that the contract may involve services that are not commercial.

Therefore, the prime contractor should consider flowing down the following clauses to the subcontractor, based on the FAR Subpart 44.4 and the contract's PECP clause:

52.203-13, Contractor Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (NOV 2021)

Recommendations:

The prime contractor should carefully review the contract and the FAR Subpart 44.4 to ensure that all required clauses are flowed down to the subcontractor. If the contract involves services that are not commercial, the prime contractor should consult with legal counsel to determine the specific clauses that must be flowed down.

Caveats:

This analysis is based on the information provided in the contract and the FAR document. Additional information may be needed to provide more specific advice.
The prime contractor should always consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. </legal_opinion>
