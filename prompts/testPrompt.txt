Orders placed under EOP V is expected to establish price reasonableness in accordance with (IAW) FAR 15.4 
Contract Pricing. However, the CO is authorized to establish different hourly rates suited to meet the agency’s 
specific requirements and determine fair and reasonable pricing IAW FAR 15.4 Contract Pricing. Rates may only 
be exceeded when unique circumstances, such as geographic area or security clearances, are explained by the 
contractor to the satisfaction of the CO. COs need to perform an independent analysis before accepting any 
loaded rate that exceeds the rate in the basic contract. If adequate price competition is not present, or the CO 
cannot otherwise determine price reasonableness, the CO may request information other than cost or pricing data 
IAW FAR 15.403-3.

APPLICABILITY DETERMINED AT TASK ORDER LEVEL




CLAUSE WITH ALTERNATE    PRESCRIPTION




FAR 52.227-14 Alternate I    “For contracts that do not require the development, 
use, or delivery of items, components, or processes 
that are intended to be acquired by or for the 
Government, an agency may adopt the alternate 
definition of limited rights data set forth in Alternate I 
to the clause at 52.227-14. The alternate definition 
does not require that the data pertain to items, 
components, or processes developed at private 
expense; but rather that the data were developed at 
private expense and embody a trade secret or are 
commercial or financial and confidential or 
privileged.” FAR 27.404-2(b)




FAR 52.227-14 Alternate II    “The clause at 52.227-14 with its Alternate II enables 
the Government to require delivery of limited rights 
data rather than allow the contractor to withhold the 
data. To obtain delivery, the contract may identify and 
specify data to be delivered, or the contracting officer 
may require, by written request during contract 
performance, the delivery of data that has been 
withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph 
(g)(1) of the clause. In addition, the contract may 
specifically identify data that are not to be delivered 
under Alternate II or which, if delivered, will be 
delivered with limited rights.” See FAR 27.404-2(c)




FAR 52.227-14 Alternate III    “Alternate III of the clause at 52.227-14, enables the

software rather than allow the contractor to withhold 
such restricted computer software.” See FAR 27.404-
2(d)




FAR 52.227-14 Alternate V    “If the Government needs the right to inspect certain 
data at a contractor’s facility, use the clause with its 
Alternate V.” See FAR 27.404-6

If a patent is issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. PTO) or the patent office of any 
foreign country based on any information asserted to be limited rights data, the Government will no longer treat 
any data contained in such issued patent as limited rights data. In addition, if any information asserted to be 
limited rights data results in or becomes a Subject Invention, as that term is defined in the patent rights clause of 
this agreement, the Government will only treat such data as limited rights data until the Contractor has filed its 
initial patent application.


(c) The Contractor shall not introduce or utilize any limited rights data not identified in above without advance 
written notification to the Contracting Officer.


(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, the following data shall be delivered to the. Government

Page 16(b) Contractor performance will be evaluated at least annually at the contract or task-order level, as determined by 
the Contracting Officer. Evaluation categories may include any or all of the following at the Government's 
discretion: (1) technical/quality, (2) cost control, (3) schedule, (4) management or business relations, and (5) 
small business subcontracting. Past performance information is available at https://www.cpars.gov. It is 
recommended that the Contractor take the overview training found on the CPARS website. The Contractor shall 
acknowledge receipt of the Government's request for comments on CPARS assessments at the time it is received 
and shall respond to such requests within fourteen (14) calendar days of the request.


(c) Joint Ventures. Performance assessments shall be prepared on contracts with joint ventures. When the joint 
venture has a unique Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and unique entity identifier, a single 
assessment will be prepared for the joint venture using its CAGE code and unique entity identifier. If the joint 
venture does not have a unique CAGE code and unique entity identifier, separate assessments, containing 
identical narrative, will be prepared for each participating contractor and will state that the evaluation is based on 
performance under a joint venture and will identify the contractors that were part of the joint venture.

Page 24(h) An ombudsman has been designated at the contracting activity awarding this contract to ensure that all 
contractors are afforded a "fair opportunity" to be considered for task or delivery orders pursuant to FAR 16.5. 
The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer, but to receive on 
behalf of and to communicate to the appropriate Government personnel concerns and disagreements of 
contractors not receiving a specific task and to work to resolve the matter. When requested, the ombudsman will 
maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the original 
selection of contractors or in the evaluation or determination of the issuance of task or delivery orders under this 
contract, does not act in the capacity of a Contracting Officer, and does not participate in the adjudication of 
contract disputes in regard to multiple award task or delivery order contracts awarded pursuant to FAR 16.5.


DOE-H-2033 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (OCT 2014)


(a) The DOE and the Contractor both recognize that methods for fair and efficient resolution of contractual issues 
in controversy by mutual agreement are essential to the successful and timely completion of contract 
requirements. Accordingly, DOE and the Contractor shall use their best efforts to informally resolve any 
contractual issue in controversy by mutual agreement. Issues of controversy may include a dispute, claim, 
question, or other disagreement. The parties agree to negotiate with each other in good faith, recognizing their 
mutual interests, and attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties.


(b) If a mutual agreement cannot be reached through negotiations within a reasonable period of time, the parties 
may use a process of alternate dispute resolution (ADR) in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, 
Disputes. The ADR process may involve mediation, facilitation, fact-finding, group conflict management, and 
conflict coaching by a neutral party. The neutral party may be an individual, a board comprised of independent 
experts, or a company with specific expertise in conflict resolution or expertise in the specific area of 
controversy. The neutral party will not render a binding decision, but will assist the parties in reaching a mutually 
satisfactory agreement. Any opinions of the neutral party shall not be admissible in evidence in any subsequent 
litigation proceedings.


(c) Either party may request that the ADR process be used. The Contractor shall make a written request to the 
Contracting Officer, and the Contracting Officer shall make a written request to the appropriate official of the 
Contractor. A voluntary election by both parties is required to participate in the ADR process. The parties must 
agree on the procedures and terms of the process, and officials of both parties who have the authority to resolve 
the issue must participate in the agreed upon process.


(d) ADR procedures may be used at any time that the Contracting Officer has the authority to resolve the issue in 
controversy. If a claim has been submitted by the Contractor, ADR procedures may be applied to all or a portion 
of the claim. If ADR procedures are used subsequent to issuance of a Contracting Officer's final decision under 
the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, their use does not alter any of the time limitations or procedural 
requirements for filing an appeal of the Contracting Officer's final decision and does not constitute 
reconsideration of the final decision.


(e) If the Contracting Officer rejects the Contractor's request for ADR proceedings, the Contracting Officer shall 
provide the Contractor with a written explanation of the specific reasons the ADR process is not appropriate for 
the resolution of the dispute. If the Contractor rejects the Contracting Officer's request to use ADR procedures, 
the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with the reasons for rejecting the request.

Management, and 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, the 




Page 26Department of Energy (DOE) is committed to managing its facilities in a manner that will promote the natural 
environment and protect the health and well-being of its Federal employees and contractor service providers. The 
Contractor shall use its best efforts to support DOE in meeting those commitments, including sustainable 
acquisition or environmentally preferable contracting which may involve several interacting initiatives, such as -


(1) Alternative Fueled Vehicles and Alternative Fuels;


(2) Biobased Content Products (USDA Designated Products);


(3) Energy Efficient Products;


(4) Non-Ozone Depleting Alternative Products;


(5) Recycled Content Products (EPA Designated Products); and


(6) Water Efficient Products (EPA Water Sense Labeled Products).


(b) The Contractor should become familiar with these information resources:


(1) Recycled Products are described at https://www.epa.gov/smm/comprehensive-procurement-guideline-
cpg-program.


(2) Biobased Products are described at https://www.biopreferred.gov/BioPreferred/.


(3) Energy efficient products are described at https://www.energystar.gov/products for Energy Star 
products.


(4) FEMP designated products are described at https://www.energy.gov/eere/femp/energy-efficient-

(c) If, in the course of providing services at the DOE site, the Contractor's services necessitate the acquisition of 
any of the above types of products, it is expected that the Contractor will acquire the sustainable, environmentally 
preferable models unless the product is not available competitively within a reasonable time, at a reasonable 
price, is not life cycle cost efficient in the case of energy consuming products, or does not meet reasonable 
performance standards. While there is no formal reporting, DOE prepares a sustainable acquisition annual report 
and the Contractor may be asked by the Contracting Officer to provide information in support of DOE's report.

Page 36DOE-H-2068 CONFERENCE MANAGEMENT (MAR 2023)
The Contractor agrees that:


(a) The contractor shall ensure that contractor-sponsored conferences, and contractor participation in DOE 
conferences sponsored by a Departmental Element, reflect the DOE/NNSA's commitment to fiscal responsibility, 
appropriate stewardship of taxpayer funds and support the mission of DOE/NNSA as well as other sponsors of 
work. In addition, the contractor shall ensure its sponsored conferences do not include any activities that create 
the appearance of taxpayer funds being used in a questionable manner.


(b) For the purposes of this clause, “conference” is first defined by the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) as 
“[a] meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium, or event that involves attendee travel. The term 'conference' also 
applies to training activities that are considered to be conferences under 5 C.F.R 410.404.” Additionally, the 
Department’s conference activity reporting guideline expands the FTR conference definition to disregard attendee 
travel as a determining factor, i.e., reporting can be required without the existence of attendee travel.


(c) Contractor-sponsored conferences include those events that meet the Department’s expanded conference 
definition, and a DOE contractor holds the role of primary decision-maker for key planning items such as 
conference theme, agenda, location/venue, dates, and conference participation.


(d) Merely providing the contractor’s facility space for a conference, or contractor staff participating in a 
conference, or procuring conference booth space, giving a speech, or serving as an honorary chairperson does not 
connote contractor sponsorship.


(e) The contactor will provide information on conferences they plan to sponsor, when expected costs exceed 
$100,000 in net costs to the Department, in the Department’s Conference Management Tool (CMT), including:


1) Conference title, description, and date


2) Location and venue


3) Description of any unusual expenses (e.g., promotional items)


4) Description of contracting procedures used (e.g., competition for space/support)


5) Costs for space, food/beverages, audio visual, travel/per diem, attendee registration costs


6) Number of attendees


(f) The contractor will not expend funds on the proposed contractor-sponsored conferences with expenditures 
estimated to exceed $100,000 until notified of approval by the contracting officer and approved by the 
corresponding federal executive oversight entity.




Page 37(g) For DOE-sponsored conferences (i.e., sponsored by a Departmental Element), the contractor will not expend 
funds on the proposed conference that exceeds $100,000 in net estimated DOE cost, until it is approved in the 
CMT by the management of the Departmental Element sponsoring the conference,


1) DOE-sponsored conferences include events that meet the Department’s expanded conference 
definition, and a Departmental Element holds the role of primary decision-maker for key planning items 
such as conference theme, agenda, location/venue, dates and conference participation.


2) Merely providing Federal facility space for a conference, or Federal staff participating in a conference, 
or procuring conference booth space, giving a speech, or serving as an honorary chairperson does not 
connote DOE sponsorship.


3) The contractor will provide cost and attendance information on their participation in all DOE- 
sponsored conferences in the DOE Conference Management Tool.


(h) For conferences sponsored by a non-DOE external entity, the contractor shall develop and implement a 
process to ensure costs related to such conferences are tracked, allowable, allocable, reasonable, and further the 
mission of DOE/NNSA.


(i) Contractors are not required to enter participation or cost information on conferences sponsored by a non- 
DOE external entity in DOE'S Conference Management Tool.

52.243-2 CHANGES - COST-REIMBURSEMENT. (AUG 1987) - ALTERNATE I (APR 1984) and FAR 52.243-3 
CHANGES - TIME-AND-MATERIALS OR LABOR-HOURS. (SEP 2000).


(e) Regardless of the performer of the work, the Contractor is responsible for compliance with the requirements 
of this clause. The Contractor shall include this clause in all subcontracts to the extent necessary to ensure the 
Contractor's compliance with these requirements.


DOE-H-2074 LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION - SEPARATE INCREMENTAL 
FUNDING OF CONTRACT'S FIXED-PRICE CLINS; AND SEPARATE FULL FUNDING OF THE 
FIXED PRICE OF PORTION OF THE WORK FOR WHICH FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOTTED (NOV 
2018) [FIRM-FIXED-PRICE TASK ORDERS ONLY]
(a) This contract’s [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] contain Federal Acquisition
Regulation fixed prices and contract terms and conditions as set forth in the contract, with the exceptions that: 
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] may be incrementally funded; and if a [Fill-in at time of Task Order 
Award] is incrementally funded as set forth in the contract, in the event of termination before it is fully funded the 
Government’s maximum liability for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] will be the lower of the amount of 
funds allotted to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] or the amount payable to the Contractor per the 
Termination for Convenience (Fixed-Price) clause of this contract. For each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] 
there is 


(1) a fixed price; 


(2) a specified scope of work that corresponds to the fixed price;


(3) an anticipated funding schedule that corresponds to the fixed price and the specified
scope of work (the parties contemplate that the Government will allot some funds upon execution of the 
contract);




Page 40(4) a Government maximum obligation to the Contractor equal to the funds allotted to the
contract for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award];


(5) if the Government incrementally allots funds, both a fixed price for the services the
allotted funds cover and a maximum Government obligation, including any termination obligations, to the 
Contractor equal to the allotted funds; and


(6) an obligation that the Government will pay the Contractor only for the work the
Contractor performed: for which funds were allotted; and based only on the fixed price for the services the 
allotted funds covered (established when the funds were allotted) and the portion of the services performed, 
not the costs the Contractor may actually incur.


(b) For each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]


(1) the Government’s maximum obligation, including any termination obligations and
obligations under change orders, equitable adjustments, or unilateral or bilateral contract modifications, at any 
time is always less than or equal to the total amount of funds allotted by the Government to the contract for 
the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] and the total amount of funds allotted by the Government to the 
contract for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] is the fixed price of the work for which the funds are 
allotted;


(2) the Contractor explicitly agrees the fixed price in the contract reflects:


(i) any additional complexities, challenges, and risks (including all risks, costs or
otherwise, associated with any potential termination for convenience, or other risks as articulated in this 
clause) to which the Contractor is subject due to the incremental funding arrangement established in this 
clause; and


(ii) the specific risk that in the event of termination of an incrementally funded
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] before the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] is fully funded, the 
Contractor could receive less than the amount the Termination for Convenience (Fixed-Price) clause of 
this contract would usually permit, that is, the Government is only obligated to provide to the contractor 
the lower of the amount of the allotted funds or the amount as determined under the Termination for 
Convenience (Fixed-Price) clause of this contract;


(3) the Contractor is not authorized to continue work beyond the point at which the total
amount payable by the Government, which is the price of the services the allotted funds cover, equals the total 
amount allotted to the contract for the services;


(4) if additional funds become available and the Government still has a need for the
services in the Contract, the Government will allot funds periodically to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order 
Award], the Contractor will continue performance and will provide a specified and fixed amount of work for 
the additional funds allotted, and the Government will pay the Contractor based on the price of the fixed 
amount work. The Government will not pay the Contractor based on the costs the Contractor incurs in 
performing the work; and




Page 41

(5) the Contractor agrees to provide the specified and fixed amount of work for the fixed
price identified in the Contract’s Section B, Supplies or services and prices/costs, and in accordance with the 
delivery schedule identified in the contract’s Section F, Deliveries or performance, provided the Government 
provides the funding per or earlier than the Planned Funding Schedule in paragraph (n) of this clause. At any 
time, the cumulative amount of funds allotted is the fixed price for the cumulative fixed amount of work 
identified with the funds.


(c) For each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]


(1) The fixed price (of both [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] and of the current cumulative
amount of funds allotted to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] at any time during contract 
performance) is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the Contractor’s cost experience;


(2) The contract places the maximum risk and full responsibility on the Contractor for all
costs and resulting profit or loss; and


(3) If the Government meets the entire Planned Funding Schedule, 


(i) the cumulative amount of funds allotted will equal the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] fixed
price and


(ii) the Contractor shall provide the entire scope of work the Contract requires for the
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award].


(d) The fixed price for each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] is listed in Section B of this contract.


(e) The Planned Funding Schedule for each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] is in paragraph (n) of this
clause. The sum of the planned funding for each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]  equals the fixed price of 
the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award].


(f) The Actual Funding Schedule for each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] is in paragraph (o) of this
clause. It specifies the actual amount of funds allotted and presently available for payment by the Government 
separately for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] and the specific work to be performed for the funds allotted.


(1) The Contractor may submit an invoice under [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] only after the
Government has allotted funds to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] and the Contractor has provided 
services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract. The Contractor may submit an invoice 
for only the lower of the two preceding amounts, that is, the lower of


(i) the amount of allotted funds for the specified work (which is the amount of the
fixed price of the specified work) or


(ii) the amount equal to the portion of the fixed price for the specified work the
Contractor has earned by providing a portion of the fixed work.




Page 42

(g) If during the course of this contract the Government is allotting funds to
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] per or earlier than the Planned Funding Schedule, this contract to that point 
will be considered a simple fixed-price contract for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] regardless of the rate at 
which the Contractor is, or is not, earning amounts payable, and


(1) The Government’s and the Contractor’s obligations under the contract for the
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] —with the exception that the Government’s obligation for the [Fill-in at 
time of Task Order Award] is limited to the total amount of funds allotted by the Government to the [Fill-in at 
time of Task Order Award] and similarly the Contractor is not authorized to continue work beyond the point 
at which the total amount payable by the Government equals the total amount allotted—will be as if the [Fill-
in at time of Task Order Award] were both fixed price and fully funded at time of contract execution, that is, 
the Contractor agrees that: it will perform the work of the contract for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]; 
and neither the fixed-price for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] nor any other term or condition of the 
contract will be affected due to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] being incrementally funded.




(i)    The Contractor agrees, for example, if the Government allots funds to [Fill-in at time of Task Order 
Award] per or earlier than all of the funding dates in the Planned Funding Schedule for the [Fill-in at 
time of Task Order Award], the Government has met all of its obligations just as if the [Fill-in at time 
of Task Order Award] were fully funded as of the time of contract execution and the Contractor 
retains all of its obligations as if the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] were fully funded as of the 
time of contract execution, while at the same time the Contractor is not authorized to continue work 
beyond the point at which the total amount payable by the Government equals the total amount 
allotted to the contract; consequently, if the Contactor earns amounts payable at any time in 
performing work for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] that exceed the total amount of funds 
allotted by the Government to the contract for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]


A. it (not the Government) will be liable for those excess amounts payable 


B. it will remain liable for its obligations under every term or condition of the contract and 


C. if it fulfills all of its obligations for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]  and the Government 
allots funds to 
the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] equal to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] fixed 
price, the Government will pay it the fixed price for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] and 
no more.


(ii) The Contractor also agrees, for example, if the Government allots funds to
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] by the first funding date in the Planned Funding Schedule, the 
Government has met all of its obligations up to that point in the contract as if the [Fill-in at time of Task 
Order Award] were fully funded (that is, as if progress payments based on cost had been agreed to and 
had been made, or milestone payments had agreed to and been made, etc.) and the Contractor retains all of 
its obligations up to that point (such as meeting delivery schedules, maintaining quality, etc.) as if the 
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] were fully funded; consequently, if the Government subsequently 
terminates the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] it will pay the Contractor the lower of the following 




Page 43two amounts: the amount allotted by the Government to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]; or the 
amount payable per the Termination for Convenience (Fixed-Price) clause of this contract.


(h) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing whenever it has reason to
believe that the total amount payable by the Government, which is the portion of the price of the services the 
allotted funds cover that the Contractor has earned, for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] in the next [Fill-
in at time of Task Order Award], when added to all amounts payable previously earned, will exceed [Fill-in at 
time of Task Order Award] of the total amount allotted to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] by the 
Government.


(1) The notification is for the Government’s planning purposes only and does not change
any obligation of either the Government or the Contractor.


(2) The Contractor is not authorized to continue work beyond the point at which the total
amount payable by the Government equals the total amount allotted to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order 
Award]. 


(3) The Government may require the Contractor to continue performance of
[Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] for as long as the Government allots funds for [Fill-in at time of Task 
Order Award] sufficient to cover the amount payable for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award].


(i) If the Government does not allot funds to [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] per or earlier than its Planned
Funding Schedule, the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment and


(1) the Government’s maximum obligation, including any termination obligation, to
reimburse the Contractor remains limited to the total amount of funds allotted by the Government to the 
contract for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award];


(2) the Contractor is not authorized to continue work beyond the point at which the total
amount payable by the Government equals the total amount allotted to the contract;


(3) if the Government subsequently terminates the contract or the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] , it 
will pay the Contractor the lower of the following two amounts: the total amount of funds allotted by the 
Government to the contract for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]; or the amount payable per the 
Termination for Convenience (Fixed-Price) clause of this contract. 


(j) Except as required by either other provisions of this contract specifically citing and stated to
be an exception to this clause, or by, among other things, terminations, change orders, equitable adjustments, or 
unilateral or bilateral contract modifications specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause, for 
each [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] — 


(1) The Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the total
amount allotted by the Government to this contract for the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]; and 


(2) The Contractor is not obligated to continue performance under this contract related to




Page 44the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] in excess of the amount allotted to the contract (which is also both 
the maximum amount payable and the price of the services the allotted funds cover) by the Government until 
the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the amount allotted by the Government has been 
increased and specifies an increased amount, which shall then constitute the total amount allotted by the 
Government to the [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award].


(k) No notice, communication, or representation in any form, including, among other things,
change orders, equitable adjustments, or unilateral or bilateral contract modifications, other than that specified in 
this clause, or from any person other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect the amount allotted by the 
Government to this contract for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award], which will remain at all times the 
Government’s maximum liability for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award]. In the absence of the specified notice, 
the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for any amounts payable earned for [Fill-in at time 
of Task Order Award] in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to this contract for [Fill-in at time 
of Task Order Award].


(l) Change orders, equitable adjustments, unilateral or bilateral contract modifications, or
similar actions shall not be considered increases in the Government’s maximum liability or authorizations to the 
Contractor to exceed the amount allotted by the Government for [Fill-in at time of Task Order Award] unless they 
contain a statement increasing the amount allotted.


(m)Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government to terminate this contract for
convenience or default.

DOE-H-2075 PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR CERTAIN NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS 
(OCT 2014)


The Contractor agrees that:


(a) No cost associated with implementation or enforcement of nondisclosure policies, forms or agreements 
shall be allowable under this contract if such policies, forms or agreements do not contain the following 
provisions: "These provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter 
the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive order relating to:


(1) classified information,


(2) communications to Congress,


(3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or 
mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger 
to public health or safety, or




Page 45(4) any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, 
sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling Executive orders and statutory provisions are 
incorporated into this agreement and are controlling."


(b) The limitation above shall not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, 
or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified 
information.


(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), a nondisclosure or confidentiality policy form or 
agreement that is to be executed by a person connected with the conduct of an intelligence or intelligence-
related activity, other than an employee or officer of the United States Government, may contain 
provisions appropriate to the particular activity for which such document is to be used. Such form or 
agreement shall, at a minimum, require that the person will not disclose any classified information 
received in the course of such activity unless specifically authorized to do so by the United States 
Government. Such nondisclosure or confidentiality forms shall also make it clear that they do not bar 
disclosures to Congress, or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice, 
that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.


DOE-H-2076 LOBBYING RESTRICTIONS (NOV 2018)

DOE-H-2084 MITIGATING SUPPLY CHAIN RISK (OCT 2022) 


DOE/NNSA utilizes a Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Program to identify, assess, and monitor supply 
chain risks of critical vendors. The Government may use any information, public and non-public, including all-
source intelligence for its analysis. The Contractor agrees that the Government may, at its own discretion, 
perform audits of supply chain risk processes or events consistent with other terms in the contract regarding 
access to records and audits. An onsite assessment may be required. Through the information obtained from a 
SCRM program, DOE may assess vendors and products through multiple risk lenses such as national security, 
cybersecurity, compliance, and finance. If supply chain risks are identified and corrective action becomes 
necessary, mutually agreeable corrective actions will be sought based upon specific identified risks. Failure to 
resolve any identified risk may result in contract termination.

(1) For contracts, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3) and (6) of this clause-


[Contracting Officer check as appropriate.]


[X ] By the end of the base term of the contract and then by the end of each subsequent

52.219-28 POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REPRESENTATION. (MAR 2023) [SMALL 
BUSINESS ONLY; FILL-INS COMPLETED AT AWARD]


(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-


Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term 
does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended 
for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or 
other appropriate authority.




Page 52Small business concern-


(1) Means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in 
the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business 
under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (d) of this clause. Such a concern 
is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a 
national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily 
engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, 
including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, 
ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and 
nature of business activity.


(2) Affiliates, as used in this definition, means business concerns, one of whom directly or indirectly 
controls or has the power to control the others, or a third party or parties control or have the power to 
control the others. In determining whether affiliation exists, consideration is given to all appropriate 
factors including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. SBA 
determines affiliation based on the factors set forth at 13 CFR 121.103.


(b) If the Contractor represented that it was any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) prior to 
award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status according to paragraph 
(f) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (h) of this clause, upon occurrence of any of the following:


(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the 
contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in 
the contract.


(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after 
modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion 
of this clause in the contract.


(3) For long-term contracts-


(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and


(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option 
thereafter.


(c) If the Contractor represented that it was any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) prior to 
award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status according to paragraph 
(f) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (h) of this clause, when the Contracting Officer explicitly requires it 
for an order issued under a multiple-award contract.


(d) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this 
rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) 
assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code(s) can be found at

52.230-2 COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. (JUN 2020) [NOT APPLICABLE TO CONDITIONS SET 
FORTH IN 48 CFR § 9903.201-1, MOST NOTABLY SMALL BUSINESS]


(a) Unless the contract is exempt under 48 CFR 9903.201-1 and 9903.201-2, the provisions of 48 CFR part 9903 
are incorporated herein by reference and the Contractor, in connection with this contract, shall-


(1) (CAS-covered Contracts Only) By submission of a Disclosure Statement, disclose in writing the 
Contractor's cost accounting practices as required by 48 CFR 9903.202-1 through 9903.202-5, including 
methods of distinguishing direct costs from indirect costs and the basis used for allocating indirect costs. 
The practices disclosed for this contract shall be the same as the practices currently disclosed and applied 
on all other contracts and subcontracts being performed by the Contractor and which contain a Cost 
Accounting Standards (CAS) clause. If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that the 
Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged 
and confidential, the Disclosure Statement shall be protected and shall not be released outside of the 
Government.


(2) Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting practices in accumulating and reporting contract 
performance cost data concerning this contract. If any change in cost accounting practices is made for the 
purposes of any contract or subcontract subject to CAS requirements, the change must be applied 
prospectively to this contract and the Disclosure Statement must be amended accordingly. If the contract 
price or cost allowance of this contract is affected by such changes, adjustment shall be made in 
accordance with subparagraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this clause, as appropriate.


(3) Comply with all CAS, including any modifications and interpretations indicated thereto contained in 
48 CFR part 9904 in effect on the date of award of this contract or, if the Contractor has submitted 
certified cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on the Contractor's signed 
certificate of current cost or pricing data. The Contractor shall also comply with any CAS (or 
modifications to CAS) which hereafter become applicable to a contract or subcontract of the Contractor. 
Such compliance shall be required prospectively from the date of applicability to such contract or 
subcontract.


(4)(i) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract if the contract 
cost is affected by a change which, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, the Contractor is 
required to make to the Contractor's established cost accounting practices.


(ii) Negotiate with the Contracting Officer to determine the terms and conditions under which a 
change may be made to a cost accounting practice, other than a change made under other 
provisions of subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause; provided that no agreement may be made under 
this provision that will increase costs paid by the United States.




Page 59(iii) When the parties agree to a change to a cost accounting practice, other than a change under 
subdivision (a)(4)(i) of this clause, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes 
clause of this contract.


(5) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, as appropriate, if the Contractor or a 
subcontractor fails to comply with an applicable Cost Accounting Standard, or to follow any cost 
accounting practice consistently and such failure results in any increased costs paid by the United States. 
Such adjustment shall provide for recovery of the increased costs to the United States, together with 
interest thereon computed at the annual rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) for such period, from the time the payment by the United States was 
made to the time the adjustment is effected. In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the 
increased cost to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price 
adjustment, unless the Contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or 
should have been aware at the time of price negotiations and which it failed to disclose to the 
Government.


(b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor or a subcontractor has complied with an applicable CAS in 
48 CFR part 9904 or a CAS rule or regulation in 48 CFR part 9903 and as to any cost adjustment demanded by 
the United States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes.


(c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of the Government to examine and make copies of 
any documents, papers, or records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.


(d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts which the Contractor enters into, the substance of 
this clause, except paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other subcontracts, of any tier, including 
the obligation to comply with all CAS in effect on the subcontractor's award date or if the subcontractor has 
submitted certified cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on the subcontractor's 
signed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant 
to 48 CFR 9903.201-2 is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the substance of the applicable clause set forth 
in subsection 30.201-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) shall be inserted. This requirement shall 
apply only to negotiated subcontracts in excess of the lower CAS threshold specified in FAR 30.201-4(b) on the 
date of subcontract award, except that the requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts otherwise 
exempt from the requirement to include a CAS clause as specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.


52.230-6 ADMINISTRATION OF COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. (JUN 2010)
52.232-1 PAYMENTS. (APR 1984) [FIRM-FIXED-PRICE ORDERS ONLY]
52.232-7 PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS. (NOV 
2021)


The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the 
Contracting Officer or the authorized representative:


(a) Hourly rate. (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that 
meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are-




Page 60(i) Performed by the Contractor;


(ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or


(iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a 
common control.


(2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the 
Schedule by the number of direct labor hours performed.


(3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor 
qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor 
qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by 
employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically 
authorized by the Contracting Officer.


(4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and 
profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.


(5) Vouchers may be submitted not more than once every two weeks, to the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative. A small business concern may receive more frequent payments than 
every two weeks. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours 
reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by-


(i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;


(ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories 
specified in the contract; or


(iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.


(6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as 
otherwise provided in this contract, and subject to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the 
voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.


(7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a 
contract modification requiring the Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve 
is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the 
Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the 
amounts due under paragraph (a) of this clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall 
not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor executes and 
delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.


(8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied 
by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are 
provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer, 
overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a 




Page 61dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the 
premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by 
the Contracting Officer.


(b) Materials. (1) For the purposes of this clause-


(i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that 
are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or 
service.


(ii) Materials means-


(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, 
or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control;


(B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor 
category specified in the contract;


(C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor 
category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); and


(D) Applicable indirect costs.


(2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial product 
or commercial service in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101, the price to be paid for 
such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to 
reflect the-


(i) Quantities being acquired; and


(ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.


(3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the 
Contractor for allowable cost of materials provided the Contractor-


(i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
agreement or invoice; or


(ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's 
payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement or invoice.


(4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. 
The Contracting Officer will determine allowable costs of materials in accordance with FAR 
subpart 31.2 in effect on the date of this contract.




Page 62(5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they 
are-


(i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;


(ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting 
practices; and


(iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.


(6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-


(i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing 
prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and


(ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, 
and other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall 
promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give 
credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and 
other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the Contractor, or would have accrued 
except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross 
costs the benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through 
fault of the Government.


(7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the 
prime Contractor on materials.


(c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, 
Subcontracts, without obtaining such consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor 
for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the Contractor obtains the required consent. 
Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at the 
sole discretion of the Government.


(d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract 
shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts 
to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling 
price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs 
that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments 
and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor 
shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for 
performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this 
contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this 
contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so 
notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, 
with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the 
Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be 




Page 63substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the 
Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.


(e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the 
ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so 
would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies 
the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised 
ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent 
that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs 
incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same 
extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.


(f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit 
of the vouchers and supporting documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to 
reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer or 
authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for 
overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by 
the Contractor as the "completion voucher" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the 
Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the 
terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. 
The completion voucher, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly 
as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 120 days (or 
such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.


(g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered 
into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and 
deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release 
discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, 
and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:


(1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible 
of exact statement by the Contractor.


(2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the 
Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the 
Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in 
writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of 
any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is 
earlier.


(3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its 
indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental 
expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.




Page 64(h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services. (1) Interim payments made prior to the final 
payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not subject 
to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.


(2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 
[Contracting Officer insert day as prescribed by agency head; if not prescribed, insert "30th"] day 
after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. In the event that the 
Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure compliance 
with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to 
make payment by the specified due date.


(i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment 
under this contract, the Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 
U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

If more than one clause or Schedule term of this contract authorizes the temporary withholding of amounts 
otherwise payable to the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the total of the amounts 
withheld at any one time shall not exceed the greatest amount that may be withheld under any one clause or 
Schedule term at that time; provided, that this limitation shall not apply to -


(a) Withholdings pursuant to any clause relating to wages or hours of employees;


(b) Withholdings not specifically provided for by this contract;


(c) The recovery of overpayments; and


(d) Any other withholding for which the Contracting Officer determines that this limitation is 
inappropriate.

52.232-17 INTEREST. (MAY 2014)
52.232-22 LIMITATION OF FUNDS. (APR 1984) [COST-PLUS-FIXED-FEE AND TIME-AND-
MATERIALS ORDERS ONLY]


(a) The parties estimate that performance of this contract will not cost the Government more than (1) the 
estimated cost specified in the Schedule or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the Government's share of the 
estimated cost specified in the Schedule. The Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work 
specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within the estimated cost, which, if this is a cost-
sharing contract, includes both the Government's and the Contractor's share of the cost.




Page 65(b) The Schedule specifies the amount presently available for payment by the Government and allotted to this 
contract, the items covered, the Government's share of the cost if this is a cost-sharing contract, and the period of 
performance it is estimated the allotted amount will cover. The parties contemplate that the Government will allot 
additional funds incrementally to the contract up to the full estimated cost to the Government specified in the 
Schedule, exclusive of any fee. The Contractor agrees to perform, or have performed, work on the contract up to 
the point at which the total amount paid and payable by the Government under the contract approximates but does 
not exceed the total amount actually allotted by the Government to the contract.


(c) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing whenever it has reason to believe that the costs 
it expects to incur under this contract in the next 60 days, when added to all costs previously incurred, will exceed 
75 percent of (1) the total amount so far allotted to the contract by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing 
contract, the amount then allotted to the contract by the Government plus the Contractor's corresponding share. 
The notice shall state the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance for the period 
specified in the Schedule.


(d) Sixty days before the end of the period specified in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting 
Officer in writing of the estimated amount of additional funds, if any, required to continue timely performance 
under the contract or for any further period specified in the Schedule or otherwise agreed upon, and when the 
funds will be required.


(e) If, after notification, additional funds are not allotted by the end of the period specified in the Schedule or 
another agreed-upon date, upon the Contractor's written request the Contracting Officer will terminate this 
contract on that date in accordance with the provisions of the Termination clause of this contract. If the 
Contractor estimates that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge its obligations beyond that 
date, it may specify a later date in its request, and the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract on that later 
date.


(f) Except as required by other provisions of this contract, specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this 
clause (1) the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the total 
amount allotted by the Government to this contract and (2) the Contractor is not obligated to continue 
performance under this contract (including actions under the Termination clause of this contract) or otherwise 
incur costs in excess of (i) the amount then allotted to the contract by the Government or (ii) if this is a cost-
sharing contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor's corresponding 
share, until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the amount allotted by the Government 
has been increased and specifies an increased amount, which shall then constitute the total amount allotted by the 
Government to this contract.


(g) The estimated cost shall be increased to the extent that (1) the amount allotted by the Government or, (2) if 
this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor's 
corresponding share, exceeds the estimated cost specified in the Schedule. If this is a cost-sharing contract, the 
increase shall be allocated in accordance with the formula specified in the Schedule.


(h) No notice, communication, or representation in any form other than that specified in subparagraph (f)(2) 
above, or from any person other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect the amount allotted by the Government 
to this contract. In the absence of the specified notice, the Government is not obligated to reimburse the 




Page 66Contractor for any costs in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to this contract, whether 
incurred during the course of the contract or as a result of termination.


(i) When and to the extent that the amount allotted by the Government to the contract is increased, 
any costs the Contractor incurs before the increase that are in excess of (1) The amount previously 
allotted by the Government or (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount previously allotted 
by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor's corresponding share, shall be allowable to 
the same extent as if incurred afterward, unless the Contracting Officer issues a termination or 
other notice and directs that the increase is solely to cover termination or other specified expenses.


(j) Change orders shall not be considered an authorization to exceed the amount allotted by the Government 
specified in the Schedule, unless they contain a statement increasing the amount allotted.


(k) Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government to terminate this contract. If this contract is 
terminated, the Government and the Contractor shall negotiate an equitable distribution of all property produced 
or purchased under the contract, based upon the share of costs incurred by each.


(l) If the Government does not allot sufficient funds to allow completion of the work, the Contractor is entitled to 
a percentage of the fee specified in the Schedule equalling the percentage of completion of the work 
contemplated by this contract.

(a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be 
continued without interruption and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another 
contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to (1) furnish phase-in training and (2) exercise its best 
efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.




Page 67(b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer's written notice, (1) furnish phase-in, phase-out services 
for up to 90 days after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with a successor to determine 
the nature and extent of phase-in, phase-out services required. The plan shall specify a training program and a 
date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in the plan, and shall be subject to the 
Contracting Officer's approval. The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in, 
phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of 
proficiency.


(c) The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor 
maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract. The Contractor also shall 
disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees. 
If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date 
and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. 


(d) The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the 
agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to 
exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract.


52.239-1 PRIVACY OR SECURITY SAFEGUARDS. (AUG 1996)


(a) The Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the Contracting Officer's written consent, 
the details of any safeguards either designed or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise 
provided by the Government.


(b) To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard against threats and hazards to the 
security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data, the Contractor shall afford the Government access to 
the Contractor's facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases.


(c) If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, or if 
existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention 
of the other party.

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-


Approved purchasing system means a Contractor's purchasing system that has been reviewed and approved in 
accordance with Part 44 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).




Page 69Consent to subcontract means the Contracting Officer's written consent for the Contractor to enter into a 
particular subcontract.


Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into by a subcontractor to furnish 
supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract. It includes, but is not limited to, 
purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders.


(b) When this clause is included in a fixed-price type contract, consent to subcontract is required only on unpriced 
contract actions (including unpriced modifications or unpriced delivery orders), and only if required in 
accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this clause. 


(c) If the Contractor does not have an approved purchasing system, consent to subcontract is required for any 
subcontract that-


(1) Is of the cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, or labor-hour type; or


(2) Is fixed-price and exceeds-


(i) For a contract awarded by the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, or the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the greater of the simplified acquisition threshold, as 
defined in FAR 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of 
the contract; or


(ii) For a contract awarded by a civilian agency other than the Coast Guard and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, either the simplified acquisition threshold, as defined in 
FAR 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the 
contract.


(d) If the Contractor has an approved purchasing system, the Contractor nevertheless shall obtain the Contracting 
Officer's written consent before placing the following subcontracts: [To be Determined at Award ]


(e)(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in advance of placing any subcontract or 
modification thereof for which consent is required under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this clause, including the 
following information:


(i) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted.


(ii) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used.


(iii) Identification of the proposed subcontractor.


(iv) The proposed subcontract price.


(v) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate certified cost or pricing data and 
Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, if required by other contract provisions.

when such data are required by other provisions of this contract.


(vii) A negotiation memorandum reflecting-


(A) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;


(B) The most significant considerations controlling establishment of initial or revised 
prices;


(C) The reason certified cost or pricing data were or were not required;


(D) The extent, if any, to which the Contractor did not rely on the subcontractor's certified 
cost or pricing data in determining the price objective and in negotiating the final price;


(E) The extent to which it was recognized in the negotiation that the subcontractor's 
certified cost or pricing data were not accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by 
the Contractor and the subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total 
price negotiated;


(F) The reasons for any significant difference between the Contractor's price objective and 
the price negotiated; and


(G) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan when incentives are used. 
The explanation shall identify each critical performance element, management decisions 
used to quantify each incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all 
trade-off possibilities considered.


(2) If the Contractor has an approved purchasing system and consent is not required under paragraph (c), 
or (d) of this clause, the Contractor nevertheless shall notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in 
advance of entering into any (i) cost-plus-fixed-fee subcontract, or (ii) fixed-price subcontract that 
exceeds either the simplified acquisition threshold, as defined in FAR 2.101 on the date of subcontract 
award, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of this contract. The notification shall include the 
information required by paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this clause.


(f) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, neither consent by the Contracting Officer to 
any subcontract nor approval of the Contractor's purchasing system shall constitute a determination-


(1) Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;


(2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or


(3) To relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for performing this contract.


(g) No subcontract or modification thereof placed under this contract shall provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-
percentage-of-cost basis, and any fee payable under cost-reimbursement type subcontracts shall not exceed the 
fee limitations in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).




Page 71(h) The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate written notice of any action or suit filed and 
prompt notice of any claim made against the Contractor by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion of the 
Contractor, may result in litigation related in any way to this contract, with respect to which the Contractor may 
be entitled to reimbursement from the Government.


(i) The Government reserves the right to review the Contractor's purchasing system as set forth in FAR Subpart 
44.3.


(j) Paragraphs (c) and (e) of this clause do not apply to the following subcontracts, which were evaluated during

952.209-72 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. (AUG 2009) - ALTERNATE I (AUG 
2009)


(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, 
contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) does not obtain 
any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.




Page 72(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any 
of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Contractor") in the activities 
covered by this clause as a prime Contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any 
similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has 
the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.


(1) Use of Contractor's Work Product.


(i) The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in Department contracts, 
subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited and unsolicited) which stem directly from the 
Contractor's performance of work under this contract for a period of (Contracting Officer see 48 
CFR 909.507-2 and enter specific term) years after the completion of this contract. Furthermore, 
unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not perform any 
advisory and assistance services work under this contract on any of its products or services or the 
products or services of another firm if the Contractor is or has been substantially involved in their 
development or marketing. Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Contractor from 
competing for follow-on contracts for advisory and assistance services.


(ii) If, under this contract, the Contractor prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of 
work or specifications to be used in competitive acquisitions, the Contractor shall be ineligible to 
perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based on such statement of 
work or specifications. The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such 
statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, in 
which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.


(iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Contractor from offering or selling its standard 
and commercial items to the Government.


(2) Access to and use of information.


(i) If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to information, such as 
Department plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy 
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to 
the public, the Contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer it 
shall not-


(A) use such information for any private purpose unless the information has been released 
or otherwise made available to the public;


(B) compete for work for the Department based on such information for a period of six (6) 
months after either the completion of this contract or until such information is released or 
otherwise made available to the public, whichever is first;


(C) submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based on such information 
until one year after such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; 
and




Page 73(D) release such information unless such information has previously been released or 
otherwise made available to the public by the Department.


(ii) In addition, the Contractor agrees that to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary 
data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or other confidential or privileged 
technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it shall treat such information in 
accordance with any restrictions imposed on such information.


(iii) The Contractor may use technical data it first produces under this contract for its private 
purposes consistent with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) and (D) of this clause and the patent, rights in 
data, and security provisions of this contract.


(c) Disclosure after award.


(1) The Contractor agrees that, if changes, including additions, to the facts disclosed by it prior to award 
of this contract, occur during the performance of this contract, it shall make an immediate and full 
disclosure of such changes in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such disclosure may include a 
description of any action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or 
mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. The Department may, however, terminate the contract for 
convenience if it deems such termination to be in the best interest of the Government.


(2) In the event that the Contractor was aware of facts required to be disclosed or the existence of an 
actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and did not disclose such facts or such conflict of 
interest to the Contracting Officer, DOE may terminate this contract for default.


(d) Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any facts 
required to be disclosed concerning this contract, including the existence of an actual or potential organizational 
conflict of interest at the time of or after award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify 
the Contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted 
by law or this contract.


(e) Waiver. Requests for waiver under this clause shall be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall 
include a full description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. If it is determined to be in 
the best interests of the Government, the Contracting Officer may grant such a waiver in writing.


(f) Subcontracts.


(1) The Contractor shall include a clause, substantially similar to this clause, including this paragraph (f), 
in subcontracts expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold determined in accordance with 48 
CFR part 13 and involving the performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at 
48 CFR 2.101. The terms "contract, " "Contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately 
modified to preserve the Government's rights.


(2) Prior to the award under this contract of any such subcontracts for advisory and assistance services, the 
Contractor shall obtain from the proposed subcontractor or consultant the disclosure required by 48 CFR 
909.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual or significant 




Page 74potential for an organizational conflict of interest. Where an actual or significant potential organizational 
conflict of interest is identified, the Contractor shall take actions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the 
organizational conflict to the satisfaction of the Contractor. If the conflict cannot be avoided or 
neutralized, the Contractor must obtain the approval of the DOE Contracting Officer prior to entering into 
the subcontract.


952.215-70 KEY PERSONNEL. (DEC 2000)


(a) The personnel listed below or elsewhere in this contract [Program Manager] are considered essential to the 
work being performed under this contract. Before removing, replacing, or diverting any of the listed or specified 
personnel, the Contractor must:


(1) Notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in advance;


(2) submit justification (including proposed substitutions) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the 
impact on this contract; and


(3) obtain the Contracting Officer's written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Contractor 
deems immediate removal or suspension of any member of its management team is necessary to fulfill its 
obligation to maintain satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, and integrity under the 
clause at 48 CFR 970.5203-3, Contractor's Organization, the Contractor may remove or suspend such 
person at once, although the Contractor must notify Contracting Officer prior to or concurrently with such 
action.


(b) The list of personnel may, with the consent of the contracting parties, be amended from time to time during 
the course of the contract to add or delete personnel.

PAYMENT.]


952.242-70 TECHNICAL DIRECTION. (DEC 2000)


(a) Performance of the work under this contract shall be subject to the technical direction of the DOE Contracting 
Officer's Representative (COR). The term "technical direction" is defined to include, without limitation:


(1) Providing direction to the Contractor that redirects contract effort, shift work emphasis between work 
areas or tasks, require pursuit of certain lines of inquiry, fill in details, or otherwise serve to accomplish 
the contractual Statement of Work.


(2) Providing written information to the Contractor that assists in interpreting drawings, specifications, or 
technical portions of the work description.


(3) Reviewing and, where required by the contract, approving, technical reports, drawings, specifications, 
and technical information to be delivered by the Contractor to the Government.




Page 75(b) The Contractor will receive a copy of the written COR designation from the Contracting Officer. It will 
specify the extent of the COR's authority to act on behalf of the Contracting Officer.


(c) Technical direction must be within the scope of work stated in the contract. The COR does not have the 
authority to, and may not, issue any technical direction that-


(1) Constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the Statement of Work;


(2) Constitutes a change as defined in the contract clause entitled "Changes;"


(3) In any manner causes an increase or decrease in the total estimated contract cost, the fee (if any), or 
the time required for contract performance;


(4) Changes any of the expressed terms, conditions or specifications of the contract; or


(5) Interferes with the Contractor's right to perform the terms and conditions of the contract.


(d) All technical direction shall be issued in writing by the COR.


(e) The Contractor must proceed promptly with the performance of technical direction duly issued by the COR in 
the manner prescribed by this clause and within its authority under the provisions of this clause. If, in the opinion 
of the Contractor, any instruction or direction by the COR falls within one of the categories defined in (c)(1) 
through (c)(5) of this clause, the Contractor must not proceed and must notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
within five (5) working days after receipt of any such instruction or direction and must request the Contracting 
Officer to modify the contract accordingly. Upon receiving the notification from the Contractor, the Contracting 
Officer must-


(1) Advise the Contractor in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Contractor's letter that the 
technical direction is within the scope of the contract effort and does not constitute a change under the 
Changes clause of the contract;


(2) Advise the Contractor in writing within a reasonable time that the Government will issue a written 
change order; or 


(3) Advise the Contractor in writing within a reasonable time not to proceed with the instruction or 
direction of the COR.


(f) A failure of the Contractor and Contracting Officer either to agree that the technical direction is within the 
scope of the contract or to agree upon the contract action to be taken with respect to the technical direction will be 
subject to the provisions of the clause entitled "Disputes."

52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (AUG 2020)


(a)


(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—


(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals–


(A) Are □ are not □ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared 
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;


(B) Have □ have not □, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of 
or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal 
offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, 
State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes 
relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, 
bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, 
violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", 
the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);


(C) Are □ are not □ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a 
governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;


(D) Have □, have not □, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of 
any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds the threshold at 9.104-5(a)(2) for 
which the liability remains unsatisfied.


(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:


(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined 
if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a 
pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial 
challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all 
judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.


(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent 
if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due 
and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced 
collection action is precluded.




Page 80(2) Examples.


(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 
6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed 
tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax 
liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final 
tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.


(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed 
tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 
entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals 
contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS 
determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the 
taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the 
taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a 
delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek 
tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has 
exercised all judicial appeal rights.


(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to 
I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full 
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent 
because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.


(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not 
delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 
(the Bankruptcy Code).


(ii) The Offeror has □ has not □, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more 
contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.


(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a 
person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general 
manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).


This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of 
a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, 
Title 18, United States Code.


(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract 
award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason 
of changed circumstances.


(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in 
withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a 




Page 81determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such 
additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.


(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order 
to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and 
information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the 
ordinary course of business dealings.


(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was 
placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate 
the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.


52.209-11 REPRESENTATION BY CORPORATIONS REGARDING DELINQUENT TAX LIABILITY 
OR A FELONY CONVICTION UNDER ANY FEDERAL LAW. (FEB 2016)


(a) As required by sections 744 and 745 of Division E of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations 
Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235), and similar provisions, if contained in subsequent appropriations acts, the 
Government will not enter into a contract with any corporation that–


(1) Has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative 
remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an 
agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, where the awarding agency is 
aware of the unpaid tax liability, unless an agency has considered suspension or debarment of the 
corporation and made a determination that suspension or debarment is not necessary to protect the 
interests of the Government; or


(2) Was convicted of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding 24 months, 
where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless an agency has considered suspension or 
debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this action is not necessary to protect the 
interests of the Government.


(b) The Offeror represents that–


(1) It is □ is not □ a corporation that has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which

the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Labor.

providing the information requested in paragraph (c) of Part I of this provision.

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-


Discussions are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting 
Officer’s discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.

Proposal revision is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed 
by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations.


Time, if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, 
then the period shall include the next working day.

installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control 
prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be 
accepted.


(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes 
the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of 
receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.


(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that 
proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time 




Page 89specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the 
solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same 
time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government 
processes resume.

may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the 
person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before 
award.


(4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or 
combination of items.


(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted 
by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign 
Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time

(c) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want 
disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall –


(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed 
outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed – in whole or in part – for any 
purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of 
– or in connection with – the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, 
use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the 
Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without 
restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets (insert numbers or other 
identification of sheets); and


(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data 
contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.




Page 90(f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to 
the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the 
factors and subfactors in the solicitation.


(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.


(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.


(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors 
(except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should 
contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves 
the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the 
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive 
range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer 
may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an 
efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.


(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity 
offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.


(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional 
administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so.


(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the 
Government.


(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially 
unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable 
total evaluated price, the price of one or more line items is significantly overstated or understated as 
indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the 
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.


(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection 
authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.


(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror 
within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either 
party.


(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the 
following information, if applicable:


(i) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s 
offer.


(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed 
offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.

source selection.


(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.


(v) For acquisitions of commercial products, the make and model of the product to be delivered by 
the successful offeror.

Factors for Award, of this solicitation. However, failure to provide the requested information may make

In addition, a proposal may be eliminated from further consideration before the initial rating if the 
proposal is so grossly and obviously deficient as to be totally unacceptable on its face. For example, a 
proposal may be deemed unacceptable if it does not represent a reasonable initial effort to address the 
essential requirements of the solicitation, or if it clearly demonstrates that the offeror does not understand 
the requirements of the solicitation.

• Similar Complexity: Projects with similar challenges and risks 


(c) Work to be performed. The record of past performance provided for the offeror, major subcontractors, or other 
entities shall relate to work performed that is similar to the work that is proposed to be performed by that 
individual entity. Specific cross references shall be made between the applicable sections of the work statement, 
the work to be performed by each entity, and the relevant past performance of that entity. Each discrete record of 
past performance must be attributed to a specific entity.


(d) Newly formed entity and predecessor companies. If the offeror is a newly formed entity with no record of past 
performance for its team members as defined in FAR 9.601(1), the offeror shall provide past performance 
information for its member organization(s). The offeror, whether or not they are a newly formed entity, may 
provide past performance information for its parent organization(s), member organizations in a JV, LLC, or other 
similar or affiliated companies, provided the offeror’s proposal demonstrates that the resources of the parent, 
member, or affiliated company will be provided or relied upon in contract performance to demonstrate that the 
parent, member, or affiliate will have meaningful involvement in contract performance. Meaningful involvement 
means such things as the parent, member, or affiliate will provide material supplies, equipment, personnel, or 
other tangible assets to contract performance; or that the common parent will utilize the expertise, best practices, 
lessons learned, or similar resources from the affiliate to affect the performance of the offeror. If a common 
parent company is used to establish the nexus between the offeror and an affiliated company, the offeror must 
demonstrate how the affiliate and offeror rely on, for example, similar assets, resources, policies, and procedures 
of the common parent company. 




Page 101

The offeror or major subcontractors may also provide past performance information on predecessor companies 
that existed prior to any mergers or acquisitions, where the offeror’s proposal demonstrates such performance 
reasonably can be predictive of the offeror’s performance. 


(c) Contracts information. The offeror shall provide past performance information on 3 contracts. If the offeror is 
a newly formed entity, the offeror shall provide past performance information on 2 contracts from parent 
organization(s) or member organization if the offeror is a joint venture, LLC, or similar entity. Major 
subcontractors shall provide past performance information on 1 contract. 


(f) Past Performance Questionnaire. The offeror shall provide the Past Performance Questionnaire contained in 
Attachment H to Section J to each of the contract references. Federal references may provide a CPARS report in 
lieu of the questionnaire.  The offeror shall request that clients return the Past Performance Questionnaire, or 
CPARS report, directly to DOE by e-mail to the address identified below no later than two weeks after the date 
for receipt of proposals.


(1) DOE address and contact information. 


E-mail: Katherine Bowen, Katherine.Bowen@hq.doe.gov  


(2) Receipt of the questionnaires by the Government is not subject to the provisions at FAR 52.215-1, 
Instructions to Offerors – Competitive Acquisition related to late proposals.


DOE-L-2012 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS, VOLUME III – PRICE PROPOSAL, 
CERTIFIED COST OR PRICING DATA NOT REQUIRED (OCT 2015) – Amended .0004


Criterion 3 Price Proposal


(a) General. The offeror shall prepare its price proposal in accordance with the instructions contained in this 
provision and the guidelines and format within the Price Matrix (Attachment F).  The offeror shall utilize the 
Price Matrix to complete and submit their Price Proposal. No alternative pricing or added/altered labor categories 
will be accepted. However, the offeror may provide differing grades within the labor categories.  If omitted, the 
entire proposal will be rejected as non-responsive to the RFP. The offeror’s proposal contains the offeror’s price 
to perform the work set forth in the PWS; therefore, it must be current, accurate, complete and well documented. 
The price proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror’s proposed prices are reasonable  and reflect a 
clear understanding of the solicitation requirements. Price information is not to be included in other proposal 
volumes, unless specifically requested in the solicitation.


(b) Requirement for cost or pricing data. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1, PROHIBITION ON OBTAINING 
CERTIFIED COST OR PRICING DATA, and FAR 15.403-3, REQUIRING DATA OTHER THAN 
CERTIFIED COST OR PRICING DATA, certified cost or pricing data are not required of offerors responding to 
this solicitation. The offeror is required to submit data and information that is adequate for the Contracting 
Officer to evaluate the reasonableness of the price. If, after receipt of proposals, the Contracting Officer 
determines that there is insufficient information available to determine whether the price is reasonable, and none 
of the exceptions set forth in FAR 15.403-1, PROHIBITION ON OBTAINING CERTIFIED COST OR 
PRICING DATA, apply, the Contracting Officer may require the offeror to submit certified cost or pricing data. 




Page 102(c) Proposal accuracy. The price proposal must be mathematically correct and structured in a logical manner. 
Price totals on supporting schedules and exhibits must track to and agree with summary price totals and the 
amounts shown on the proposal cover sheet. The offeror shall round off all final monetary extensions to the 
nearest whole dollar. All labor rates shall be rounded to the nearest penny.


(d) Narrative support. The offeror, each team member, and subcontractors shall provide narrative support 
sufficient to explain the development of prices proposed; the rationale and basis for the data provided; and the 
basis for the reasonableness of the proposed prices. Submission requirements of the narrative support are outlined 
in paragraph (h). 


(c) Price reasonableness. Proposals shall be sufficiently detailed in order to demonstrate their reasonableness. The 
burden of proof for substantiating the reasonableness and credibility of proposed prices rests with the offeror. 


(f) Proposal modifications and revisions. Any modification or revisions to the price proposal, as defined and 
allowed in accordance with the provision at FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors – Competitive Acquisitions, 
shall clearly indicate the price impact of the modification to the same level of detail shown in the original 
proposal. Once the prospective contractor has been selected, the prices submitted with its proposal shall not be 
subject to change except as a result of changes due to the offeror’s certification of cost and pricing data.


(g) Contract period of performance. For pricing purposes, the offeror shall assume that contract performance will 
start on October 1, 2023. The period of performance is set forth in Section F, Deliveries or Performance.


(h) Level of detail required.


(1) The offeror shall provide fully burdened labor rates for each Labor Category in Attachment F, Price 
Matrix.  Evaluation will be made on a Time & Materials basis.


(i) Direct labor hours. Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) are provided for evaluation 
purposes only.  Each proposed position shall have hours associated with its category. The provided 
DPLH for each labor category shall not be altered. The offeror may split the hours between 
subcontractors/consultants for the same labor category, however the offeror shall ensure that the 
total DPLH proposed matches the total DPLH provided for that labor category. The offeror may 
provide differing grades within the labor categories and the offeror shall use the hours allocated to 
the specific labor category and provide a rationale for the differing grades in the narrative of the 
price proposal. 


(ii) The offeror shall provide fully burdened labor rates to establish contract T&M labor rates for 
T&M and FFP CLINS in future task orders. The T&M labor rates shall include all indirect costs 
and profit.


(2) Cost elements. The Price Matrix includes columns for Direct Labor Rate, Fringe Benefits, Overhead, 
G&A and Profit for the base year.  The Government is requesting this information to assist with the cost 
evaluation of potential future cost reimbursement task orders.  These values will not be evaluated at the 
IDIQ level and a cost realism analysis will not be done at the IDIQ level; however indirect cost elements 
shall be supported as described in paragraph (2)(ii). 




Page 103The cost elements to be addressed are as follows within the Price Matrix, with supporting information 
provided in the narrative support: 


(i) Direct labor rates. The offeror is required to identify base labor rates for the labor categories in 
the Price Matrix.  In the narrative support, the offeror is to provide support for the proposed labor 
rates; documentation may include, but is not limited to the following: DCAA or cognizant audit 
agency approval letters, current approved GSA schedule rates, approved rates accepted by other 
Federal Agencies, previously billed invoices, or timesheets. Composite, weighted or averaged 
labor rates are not requested. The offeror is required to disclose the escalation factors applied to 
current labor costs in order to estimate the proposed labor costs for future years. 


(A) Service Contract Labor Standards. The proposed contract resulting from this 
solicitation will be subject to the requirements of the Service Contract Labor Standards. All 
service employees under the contract shall be paid at least the minimum wage for their 
position specified in the wage determination attached to this solicitation, or a conformed 
minimum wage if their job does not fall under one of the defined positions. The offeror 
shall indicate in its proposal, adjacent to each labor category, whether that category or 
position is determined to be exempt (c) or non-exempt (N) from the Service Contract Labor 
Standards minimum wage and fringe benefit provisions. For any positions using conformed 
wage and fringe benefits, the offeror must show in an attachment how the conformed wage 
was developed. 


(B) Compensation policies. In the narrative support, the offeror shall provide a brief 
description of its compensation policies relating to the following areas: 


(1) Salary adjustments, including merit, cost-of-living, and other general salary 
adjustments. 
(2) Fringe benefits, including compensated absences, insurance, retirement benefits, 
and other contributions. 
(3) Travel/per diem. 
(4) Relocation. 
(5) Bonuses and other employee incentive programs. 
(6) Overtime and shift premium. 
(7) Uncompensated overtime. 


Existing company publications may be furnished in order to provide this information.


(ii) Indirect rates. 


(A) The offeror must show the proposed indirect rates by calendar for all applicable burden 
rates. The offeror must identify the application base for each burden rate, and provide 
documentation regarding the basis for the proposed rates/factors (e.g., forward pricing rate 
agreement, bidding rates, DCAA audits). The offeror must submit any current 
Government-approved written indirect rate agreement.




Page 104(iii) Profit/fee. The offeror shall identify the fee or profit amount proposed, the fee or profit 
percentage proposed, and the base to which the fee or profit is applied. 


(i) Subcontracts.


(1) The offeror must provide a listing of anticipated subcontractors and describe any affiliation with the 
offeror. Price information is required for all subcontracts in the same format and level of detail as required 
of the offeror. The offeror is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor’s pricing data. The 
offeror shall indicate whether its purchasing system has been approved by a Federal agency.


(2) If proposed subcontractors have pricing information, which they consider proprietary data, separate 
proposals may be sent directly to the Contracting Officer. All required subcontractor data must be 
submitted under the same requirements as the offeror’s price proposal.


(j) File format. The offeror must submit price proposal data using Microsoft Excel in formats compatible with the 
current version of the software and consistent with any attachments to these instructions. The offeror shall not 
provide spreadsheets using any other programs where formulas cannot be viewed. The offeror must provide 
supporting narrative consistent with the file format requirements as set forth in the provision DOE-L-2001, 
Proposal Preparation Instructions – General.


(k) Cognizant federal agency.  FAR 42.703-1(a) requires that a single agency shall be responsible for establishing 
indirect rates. This single agency, referred to as the Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA), is normally the federal 
agency with which the offeror, by fiscal year, has the largest unliquidated contract dollar amounts.


(1) The offeror shall identify its CFA, if known, by providing the following information for the offeror 
and proposed subcontractor(s):


(i) Cognizant federal agency.


(ii) Contracting Officer’s name, address, telephone number and email address.


(2) If the offeror does not know its CFA, the offeror must provide the Contracting Officer’s name, 
address, telephone number and email address for each federal agency with which it has active contracts or 
subcontracts. The offeror shall list the information starting with the oldest contract. This will help DOE to 
identify the offeror’s CFA.


(l) Professional Employee Compensation Plan.  The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the 
work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in 
reasonable relationship to the various job categories may impair the Contractor’s ability to attract and retain 
competent professional service employees or may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity 
of future task order requirements under this contract. 


Task orders under this contract may be subject to FAR 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional 
Employees. 




Page 105The Offeror must submit a Professional Employee Compensation Plan that addresses the Offeror’s methodology 
for determining salaries and fringe benefits for their professional employees in preparation of future task order 
requirements under EOP V. Submission of the general compensation practices printed in the Offeror’s employee 
handbook including salary and fringe benefits will often be sufficient. 


The Professional Employee Compensation Plan will be incorporated by reference into any resulting EOP V IDIQ.


DOE-L-2014 DATE, TIME, AND PLACE OFFERS ARE DUE (OCT 2015)


All Offers required by this solicitation are due at the date, time, and place identified on the Standard Form (SF 
33), Solicitation, Offer and Award (See Section A, Block 9). Treatment of late submissions, modifications, and 
withdrawals are governed by the applicable provisions of the solicitation. 


DOE-L-2015 OFFER ACCEPTANCE PERIOD (OCT 2015)


The offeror’s bid/proposal shall be valid for 270 calendar days after the required due date for bids/proposals. 


DOE-L-2016 NUMBER OF AWARDS (OCT 2015)


It is anticipated that there will be 10 awards resulting from this solicitation.  The Government intends to reserve at 
least 3 awards for small business.  However, the Government reserves the right to make any number of awards, or 
no award, if it is in the Government’s best interest to do so. 


Ramp-on Procedure


The Contracting Officer will periodically review the total number of contractors to ensure adequate 
competition for task orders throughout the period of performance. Over time, the total number of 
contractors may fluctuate due to various reasons including industry consolidation, significant changes in 
the marketplace or advances in technology, general economic conditions, or other reasons.


If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the government to open the contract 
to new contractors, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to announce an open season at any time 
during the effective period of the contract.


The Contracting Officer will announce this open season by publishing a notice on SAM.gov. The open 
season will be subject to applicable federal procurement laws and guidance at the time the open season is 
announced. The Open Season announcement will provide an estimate of the number of new awards that 
the Contracting Officer intends to make. Under the Open Season, the Contracting Officer will issue a 
solicitation. Any offeror meeting the eligibility requirements identified in the new “ramp on” solicitation 
may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation. However, the Contracting Officer has the discretion 
to award more or fewer contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending upon the 
quality of the offers received.


Any resulting contracts awarded under this provision will not exceed the remaining period of performance 
of the existing EOP V contracts. Any contractor receiving a contract under this open season will be 
eligible to compete on future task orders with the same rights and obligations of any other EOP V 
contractor. 




Page 106




Ramp-off Procedure


If at any point during the 10-year period of performance the contractor decides that it no longer wishes to 
participate in the contract, then the contractor may submit the request to the Contracting Officer 
requesting termination of their contract. If the Contracting Officer accepts the contractor’s request, the 
Contracting Officer will “ramp off’ the contractor using the provision under FAR 52.249-2, Termination 
for the Convenience of the Government. This provision is independent of any other action permitted under 
the contract terms and conditions. If a “ramped off” contractor is currently under contract to perform 
under any task order, the contractor will be required to continue to perform under the terms of the specific 
task order.


DOE-L-2017 EXPENSES RELATED TO OFFEROR SUBMISSIONS (OCT 2015)


This solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of any proposal or 
bid, or in making necessary studies or designs for the preparation thereof or for acquiring or contracting for any 
services relating thereto.


DOE-L-2020 SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE INFORMATION (UNRESTRICTED) (OCT 2014)


This acquisition is unrestricted and contains no small business set-aside provisions.  


DOE-L-2022 ALTERNATE BID/PROPOSAL INFORMATION – NONE (OCT 2015) 


Alternate bids/proposals are not solicited, are not desired, and will not be evaluated.


DOE-L-2025 INTENTION TO BID/PROPOSE (OCT 2015)


In order to facilitate the efficiency of the Government’s solicitation and award process through advance 
information on the anticipated number of offers, potential offerors are requested to submit the name, address and 
telephone number of its firm or organization and any subcontractors to FedConnect by June 23, 2023. If the 
bid/proposal is to be submitted by a teaming arrangement, the offeror is requested to submit the above 
information for all members of the proposing team.


DOE-L-2026 SERVICE OF PROTEST (OCT 2015)


(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an 
agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be 
served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgement of 
receipt from: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Headquarters Procurement Services, MA 642, 1000 
Independence Avenue, S .W. Washington, DC 20585.


(b) The copy of any protest must be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with 
the GAO.




Page 107(c) Another copy of a protest filed with the GAO must be furnished to the following address within the time 
periods described in paragraph (b) of this clause:

Washington, DC 20585
Fax: (202) 586-4546


DOE-L-2027 NOTICE OF PROTEST FILE AVAILABILITY (OCT 2015)


(a) If a protest of this procurement is filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with 
4 CFR part 21, any actual or prospective offeror may request the Department of Energy to provide it with 
reasonable access to the protest file pursuant to 48 CFR 33.104(a)(3)(ii), implementing section 1605 of Public 
Law 103-355. Such request must be in writing and addressed to the Contracting Officer for this procurement.


(b) Any offeror who submits information or documents to the Department for the purpose of competing in this 
procurement is hereby notified that information or documents it submits may be included in the protest file that 
will be available to actual or prospective offerors in accordance with the requirements of 48 CFR 
33.2014(a)(3)(ii). The Department will be required to make such documents available unless they are exempt 
from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, offerors shall mark any documents as to 
which they would assert that an exemption applies. (See 10 CFR part 1004.)


DOE-L-2028 AGENCY PROTEST REVIEW (OCT 2015)


Protests to the agency will be decided either at the level of the Head of the Contracting Activity or at the

Officer prior to filing a protest.




END OF SECTION L




Page 108Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award




DOE-M-2001 PROPOSAL EVALUATION - GENERAL (FEB 2019)


(a) Conduct of acquisition.


(1) This acquisition will be conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 15, 
Contracting by Negotiation; Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR), Part 915, 
Contracting by Negotiation; and the provisions of this solicitation.


(2) DOE has established a Source Evaluation Board to evaluate the proposals submitted by offerors in 
response to this solicitation. Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and the offeror's ability 
to perform the prospective contract successfully. Proposals will be evaluated solely on the factors and 
subfactors specified in the solicitation by assessing the relative significant strengths, strengths, significant 
weaknesses, weaknesses, deficiencies, and cost and performance risks of each offeror's proposal against 
the evaluation factors in this Section M to determine the offeror's ability to perform the contract.


(3) The designated source selection authority will select offerors for contract award whose proposals 
represent the best value to the Government. The source selection authority's decision will be based on a 
comparative assessment of proposals against all evaluation factors in the solicitation. The source selection 
authority may reject all proposals received in response to this solicitation, if doing so is in the best interest 
of the Government.


(b) Deficiency in proposal.


(1) A deficiency, as defined at FAR 15.001, Definitions, is a material failure of a proposal to meet a 
Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk 
of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. No award will be made to an offeror 
whose proposal is determined to be deficient.


(2) A proposal will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the proposal is 
so deficient as to be unacceptable on its face. Such deficiencies may include any exceptions or deviations 
from the terms of the solicitation. A proposal will be deemed unacceptable if it does not represent a 
reasonable initial effort to address the material requirements of the solicitation, or if it does not 
substantially comply with the proposal preparation instructions of this solicitation. Cursory responses or 
responses that merely repeat or reformulate the Master Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) 
Performance Work Statement and/or Task Order PWS will not be considered responsive to the 
requirements of the solicitation. In the event that a proposal is rejected, a notice will be sent to the Offeror 
stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be considered for further evaluation under this solicitation.


(c) Responsibility. In accordance with FAR Subpart 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors, and DEAR 
Subpart 909.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors, the Contracting Officer is required to make an affirmative 
determination of whether a prospective contractor is responsible. The Contracting Officer may, if necessary, 
conduct a preaward survey of the prospective contractor as part of the considerations in determining 
responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that the otherwise successful offeror is responsible, 




Page 109the Contracting Officer shall make a determination of nonresponsibility and no award will be made to that 
offeror; unless, the apparent successful offeror is a small business and the Small Business Administration issues a 
Certificate of Competency in accordance with FAR Part 19.6, Certificates of Competency and Determinations of 
Responsibility.


The Professional Employee Compensation Plan and Uncompensated Overtime Policy is considered an 
“operational control” related element per FAR 9.104-1(e) and will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable 
basis regarding whether the requested proposal submission information meets all the conditions for the 
information requested in Section L and is considered acceptable, accurate, and complete.


(d) Award without discussions. In accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of the provision at FAR 52.215-1, 
Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a 
contract without conducting discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal shall contain the 
offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government, however, reserves the right to 
conduct discussions. If the Government conducts discussions, it will conduct them with all offerors in the 
competitive range.


DOE-M-2001 PROPOSAL EVALUATION - GENERAL (FEB 2019) - ALTERNATE II (OCT 2015)


Organizational conflicts of interest. The offeror is required by the provision at DEAR 952.209-8, Organizational 
Conflicts of Interest Disclosure - Advisory and Assistance Services, to provide a statement of any past, present, or 
currently planned interests related to the performance of the work and a statement that an actual or potential 
conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage does or does not exist in connection with the instant contract. 
No award will be made to the apparent successful offeror, if the Contracting Officer determines that a conflict of 
interest exists that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated.


DOE-M-2002 EVALUATION FACTOR – TECHNICAL APPROACH (OCT 2015) 


The offeror will be evaluated on the degree to which its proposal demonstrates the offeror’s approach that will 
allow the successful accomplishment of the Performance Work Statement.  Strengths and weaknesses will be 
assessed for each Service Area and will culminate in a single, overall Confidence Rating for Criterion 1.


The Government reserves the right to stop the evaluation of a proposal that: 1) does not meet or exceed the 
“Some Confidence” threshold for Criterion 1; or 2) meets or exceeds the “Some Confidence” threshold for 
Criterion 1, but then receives an “Unfavorable” rating for Criterion 2.  In either scenario, the Government will not 
evaluate the proposal further under the remaining factors, and the proposal will be eliminated from further 
consideration for award.


Any proposal that does not receive a rating of at least “Some Confidence” for Criterion 1, or does not receive a 
rating of either “Favorable” or “Neutral” for Criterion 2, will not be considered for award as such proposals will 
not be among the highest technically rated, and the Government would not make award to such an Offeror at any 
price.  Any vendor who receives a Confidence Rating of “Low Confidence” or “No Confidence” for Criterion 1, 
or “Unfavorable” for Criterion 2, shall not receive an award regardless of the price proposed.


Criterion 1 – Technical Capability and Understanding
a.    The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s proposed technical approach and the specific methodology 


Page 110supporting each applicable Service Area in order to determine the degree to which the Offeror 
demonstrates the ability to perform under each Service Area.  The Government will assess the Offeror’s 
proposal for any risks associated with the Offeror in meeting the technical capabilities required.
b. The Service Areas are:
1)      Service Area 1, Program Management. 


2a)   Service Area 2a, Survey Operations (Non-Supply Based Surveys).


2b)   Service Area 2b, Survey Operations (Supply Based Surveys).


3)     Service Area 3, Energy Analysis and Modeling.


4)      Service Area 4, Information Technology Support.


5)      Service Area 5, Product/Service Development, Production and Marketing.
6)      Service Area 6, Organizational Support.


DOE-M-2008 EVALUATION FACTOR – PAST PERFORMANCE (OCT 2015) 


(a) Offeror.  The offeror will be evaluated on the currency, relevancy, and quality of its past performance, in 
performing work similar in scope, size, and complexity to that described in Section L to assess the offeror’s 
potential success in performing the work required by the contract.   


(b) Subcontractors.  In addition to evaluation of the offeror’s relevant past performance, the offeror’s proposed 
Major subcontractors and any other entities that are proposed to perform work under the contract will be 
evaluated on the quality of their recent respective past performance in performing work similar in scope, size, and 
complexity to that proposed to be performed by that performing entity. 


(c) No record of past performance.  If the offeror, subcontractors, or other performing entities do not have a 
record of relevant past performance or if information is not available, the offeror will be evaluated neither 
favorably nor unfavorably. See DOE-M-2012 BASIS FOR AWARD (OCT 2015) for definitions of these ratings.


(d) Sources of past performance information.  Note: The Offeror is solely responsible for providing examples of 
past performance and shall not rely on the Government to acquire past performance information if submitted past 
performance information is incomplete or absent.  The Government will evaluate past performance information 
provided by the offeror and other available information.  The Government may contact any or all of the 
references provided by the offeror and will consider such information obtained in its evaluation.  The 
Government may also consider past performance information from sources other than those provided by the 
offeror, such as commercial and government clients, government records, regulatory agencies, and government 
databases such as the Government’s Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System.


(e) Offeror’s Past Performance response to Volume II, Technical Proposal, will be evaluated to ensure each 
Service Area has been addressed.




Page 111DOE-M-2010 EVALUATION FACTOR – PRICE - Amended .0002


The Government will assess the reasonableness of the prices proposed in Attachment F – Price 
Matrix of the solicitation on a Time & Material basis.  Normally, price reasonableness is established 
through adequate price competition, but the Government may also determine price reasonableness 
through use of cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  Price analysis will be 
accomplished by examining and evaluating a proposed price without evaluating its separate cost 
elements and proposed profit.
For evaluation purposes, total price will be derived by multiplying fully burdened hourly labor rates 
for each labor category for the first year of the contract by the Direct Productive Labor Hours 
(DPLH) for that labor category (Prime and Subcontractor totals will be combined for purposes of 
evaluation).  However, the Government will perform Price Analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-
1 to evaluate all prices proposed in response to this solicitation and intends to review all fully 
burdened labor rates for the 10-year base, including the annual escalation of rates, for price 
reasonableness.  The Government reserves the right to verify the basis for all prices proposed, 
including review of Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs), Forward Pricing Rate 
Recommendations (FPRRs), subcontractor price quotes, GSA Schedule pricing, etc. in order to 
support the determination of pricing fair and reasonableness. 


DOE-M-2011 RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATION FACTORS (OCT 2015)


(a) The relative importance of the evaluation criteria for the Technical Proposal are listed in descending order of 
importance below.


1)

    Criterion 1 (Technical Capability and Understanding) is the most important 
criterion; and
2)    Criterion 2 (Past Performance) is the least important criterion.


Each evaluation criterion applicable to this solicitation is identified and described in this and other provisions of 
this Section M. Unless individual subcriteria within an evaluation are specifically identified and described in 
those provisions, the descriptive elements of each evaluation criterion will be considered collectively in arriving 
at the evaluated rating of the offeror's proposal for that evaluation criterion. If individual subfactors within an 
evaluation factor are specifically identified and described in those provisions, each criterion will be evaluated and 
rated individually to arrive at an overall evaluated rating for that evaluation factor.


(b) The evaluation criteria for the Technical Capability and Understanding (Criterion 1) and Past Performance 
(Criterions 2), when combined, are significantly more important than the evaluated price (Criterion 3).


DOE-M-2012 BASIS FOR AWARD (OCT 2015)


The Government intends to make award(s) to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) is/are responsive to 
the solicitation and determined to represent the best value to the Government. Selection of the best value to the 
Government will be achieved by assignment of confidence ratings through a process of evaluating the strengths 
and weaknesses of each Offeror’s proposal for Criterion 1 - Technical Capability and Understanding and 
Criterion 2 – Past Performance, in accordance with the evaluation factors described elsewhere in this document.




Page 112The source selection process for this procurement will neither be based on the Lowest Price Technically 
Acceptable (LPTA) nor Technical/Price Tradeoffs. Within the best value continuum, FAR 15.101 specifies that 
best value may be obtained using any one or a combination of source selection approaches. For this procurement, 
the best value basis for awards will be determined by the Highest Technically Rated Offerors with a Fair and 
Reasonable Price.


Award(s)will be made to the proposal(s) determined to be the Highest Technically Rated (considering the two 
non-price criteria) that have fair and reasonable pricing. The Government will not conduct a Technical/Price 
tradeoff in selecting awardees.

Criterion 2 – Past Performance
b.    The Government will evaluate all timely received proposals and rate those proposals against 
the Criteria identified above using the rating schema set forth in the Table below




Rating 
Technical (Criterion 1)
Very High 
Confidence
A comprehensive and thorough proposal of 
exceptional merit that demonstrates near complete 
competence in the entirety of the requirement and 
would mostly exceed the Government’s 
expectations. The proposal exhibits an extremely 
high probability of successful performance and 
very limited risk.  This will be evident by a 




Page 113proposal that has several significant strengths or 
strengths and few, if any, weaknesses.




High Confidence
A proposal that demonstrates near complete 
competence over of the entirety of the 
requirement and would mostly meet, and may 
exceed some of, the Government’s expectations. 
The proposal exhibits a high probability of 
successful performance and limited risk. This will 
be evident by a proposal that has some significant 
strengths or strengths and few weaknesses, with 
the advantages of the strengths outweighing the 
risk of the weaknesses. 




Some Confidence
A proposal that demonstrates competence over 
most of the requirement that would mostly meet 
the Government’s performance expectations. The 
proposal exhibits a likely probability of successful 
performance with some amount of risk. This will 
be evident by a proposal that has some strengths 
or some weaknesses, with the advantages of the 
strengths are on balance with the risk associated 
with the weaknesses. Also, this may be evident in 
a proposal that may demonstrates no, or very few 
strengths and no, or very few weaknesses where 
the magnitude of any advantages or risks are 
nominal.  
Low Confidence
A proposal that demonstrates competence over 
some or most of the requirement but fails to meet 
the Government’s expectations in significant 
parts of the requirement. The proposal exhibits a 
low probability of successful performance with a 
significant amount of risk. This will be evident by 
a proposal that has few, if any, strengths or 
several weaknesses and possible presence of 
more than one significant weakness. Within this 
element the risk associated with the weaknesses 
outweighs the advantages of any strengths that 
are present. 
No Confidence
A proposal that fails to demonstrate competence 
over most of the requirement. The proposal either 
fails to address significant parts of the requirement 




Page 114or the proposal exhibits unacceptable risk. This 
will be evident by a proposal that has no strengths 
and several weaknesses and has the presence of 
significant weaknesses. Within this element the 
risk associated with the weaknesses are so great 
that government will not consider award to the 
offeror. 




Rating 
Past Performance (Criterion 2)
Favorable 
Based on the Offeror's performance record, the 
government has a reasonable expectation that the 
Offeror will successfully perform the required 
effort, or the Offeror’s performance record is 
unknown
Neutral
The Offeror’s performance record is either not 
available or is so sparse that the Government is 
unable to form an opinion as to whether the 
Offeror is likely to successfully perform the 
required effort.
Unfavorable
Based on the Offeror's performance record, the 
government has no reasonable expectation that 
the Offeror will successfully perform the 
required effort.
