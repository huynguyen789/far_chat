 FOREWORD\

\f1\b0\fs24 The FAR is the primary regulation for use by all executive agencies in their acquisition of supplies and services with appropriated funds. It became effective on April 1, 1984, and is issued within applicable laws under the joint authorities of the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under the broad policy guidelines of the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget.\
The FAR precludes agency acquisition regulations that unnecessarily repeat, paraphrase, or otherwise restate the FAR, limits agency acquisition regulations to those necessary to implement FAR policies and procedures within an agency, and provides for coordination, simplicity, and uniformity in the Federal acquisition process. It also provides for agency and public participation in developing the FAR and agency acquisition regulation.\
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) includes all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2024-05 effective May 22, 2024. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, designation of Federal Acquisition Circulars was changed to reflect the fiscal year in the first four digits and the sequence of the issued circular in the last two digits.\

\f1\b0 This part sets forth basic policies and general information about the Federal Acquisition Regulations System including purpose, authority, applicability, issuance, arrangement, numbering, dissemination, implementation, supplementation, maintenance, administration, and deviation. \cf3 subparts 1.2\cf4 ,\cf3 1.3\cf4 , and \cf3 1.4 \cf4 prescribe administrative procedures for maintaining the FAR System.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 1.1 - Purpose, Authority, Issuance\

\fs20 1.101 Purpose.\

\f1\b0 The Federal Acquisition Regulations System is established for the codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by all executive agencies. The Federal Acquisition Regulations System consists of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is the primary document, and agency acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR. The FAR System does not include internal agency guidance of the type described in \cf3 1.301\cf4 (a)(2).\

\f0\b 1.102 Statement of guiding principles for the Federal Acquisition System.\

\f1\b0 (a) The vision for the Federal Acquisition System is to deliver on a timely basis the best value product or service to the customer, while maintaining the public\'92s trust and fulfilling public policy objectives. Participants in the acquisition process should work together as a team and should be empowered to make decisions within their area of responsibility.\
(b) The Federal Acquisition System will-\
(1) Satisfy the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service by, for example-\
(i) Maximizing the use of commercial products and commercial services;\
(ii) Using contractors who have a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to perform; and\
(iii) Promoting competition;\
(2) Minimize administrative operating costs;\
(3) Conduct business with integrity, fairness, and openness; and (4) Fulfill public policy objectives.\
(c) The Acquisition Team consists of all participants in Government acquisition including not only representatives of the technical, supply, and procurement communities but also the customers they serve, and the contractors who provide the products and services.\
(d) The role of each member of the Acquisition Team is to exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing the best value product or service to meet the customer\'92s needs. In exercising initiative, Government members of the Acquisition Team may assume if a specific strategy, practice, policy or procedure is in the best interests of the Government and is not addressed in the FAR, nor prohibited by law (statute or case law), Executive order or other regulation, that the strategy, practice, policy or procedure is a permissible exercise of authority.\

\f0\b 1.102-1 Discussion.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Introduction. 
\f1\i0 The statement of Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System (System) represents a concise statement designed to be user-friendly for all participants in Government acquisition. The following discussion of the principles is provided in order to illuminate the meaning of the terms and phrases used. The framework for the System includes the Guiding Principles for the System and the supporting policies and procedures in the FAR.\
(b) 
\f2\i Vision
\f1\i0 . All participants in the System are responsible for making acquisition decisions that deliver the best value product or service to the customer. Best value must be viewed from a broad perspective and is achieved by balancing the many competing interests in the System. The result is a system which works better and costs less.\

\f0\b 1.102-2 Performance standards.\

\f1\b0 (a) Satisfy the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service. (1) The principal customers for the product or service provided by the System are the users and line managers, acting on behalf of the American taxpayer.\
(2) The System must be responsive and adaptive to customer needs, concerns, and feedback. Implementation of acquisition policies and procedures, as well as consideration of timeliness, quality, and cost throughout the process, must take into account the perspective of the user of the product or service.\

\fs20 (3) When selecting contractors to provide products or perform services, the Government will use contractors who have a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to perform.\
(4) The Government must not hesitate to communicate with industry as early as possible in the acquisition cycle to help the Government determine the capabilities available in the marketplace. Government acquisition personnel are permitted and encouraged to engage in responsible and constructive exchanges with industry ( e.g., see \cf3 10.002 \cf4 and \cf3 15.201\cf4 ), so long as those exchanges are consistent with existing laws and regulations, and do not promote an unfair competitive advantage to particular firms.\
(5) The Government will maximize its use of commercial products and commercial services in meeting Government requirements.\
(6) It is the policy of the System to promote competition in the acquisition process.\
(7) The System must perform in a timely, high quality, and cost-effective manner.\
(8) All members of the Team are required to employ planning as an integral part of the overall process of acquiring\
products or services. Although advance planning is required, each member of the Team must be flexible in order to accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs. Planning is a tool for the accomplishment of tasks, and application of its discipline should be commensurate with the size and nature of a given task.\
(b) Minimize administrative operating costs. (1) In order to ensure that maximum efficiency is obtained, rules, regulations, and policies should be promulgated only when their benefits clearly exceed the costs of their development, implementation, administration, and enforcement. This applies to internal administrative processes, including reviews, and to rules and procedures applied to the contractor community.\
(2) The System must provide uniformity where it contributes to efficiency or where fairness or predictability is essential. The System should also, however, encourage innovation, and local adaptation where uniformity is not essential.\
(c) Conduct business with integrity, fairness, and openness. (1) An essential consideration in every aspect of the System is maintaining the public\'92s trust. Not only must the System have integrity, but the actions of each member of the Team must reflect integrity, fairness, and openness. The foundation of integrity within the System is a competent, experienced, and well-trained, professional workforce. Accordingly, each member of the Team is responsible and accountable for the wise use of public resources as well as acting in a manner which maintains the public\'92s trust. Fairness and openness require open communication among team members, internal and external customers, and the public.\
(2) To achieve efficient operations, the System must shift its focus from "risk avoidance" to one of "risk management." The cost to the taxpayer of attempting to eliminate all risk is prohibitive. The Executive Branch will accept and manage the risk associated with empowering local procurement officials to take independent action based on their professional judgment.\
(3) The Government shall exercise discretion, use sound business judgment, and comply with applicable laws and regulations in dealing with contractors and prospective contractors. All contractors and prospective contractors shall be treated fairly and impartially but need not be treated the same.\
(d) 
\f2\i Fulfill public policy objectives
\f1\i0 . The System must support the attainment of public policy goals adopted by the Congress and the President. In attaining these goals, and in its overall operations, the process shall ensure the efficient use of public resources.\

\f0\b 1.102-3 Evaluating agency acquisition processes.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies are encouraged to develop internal procedures seeking voluntary feedback from interested parties in an acquisition to assess process strengths and weaknesses and improve effectiveness and efficiency of the acquisition process. Agencies may\'97\
(1) Utilize a variety of feedback mechanisms available to the public ( 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , surveys, in-person, and/or group exchanges); (2) Utilize the core preaward and debriefing survey questions at \cf3 https://www.acquisition.gov/360\cf4 ; and\
(3) Seek additional feedback on targeted aspects of an acquisition throughout its lifecycle ( 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , performance standards\
at \cf3 1.102-2 \cf4 or postaward contract administration responsibilities at \cf3 42.302\cf4 ).\
(b) Contracting officers are encouraged to insert the provision \cf3 52.201-1\cf4 , Acquisition 360: Voluntary Survey, in accordance\
with agency procedures.\
(c) Contracting officers shall not review information until after contract award and shall not consider it in the award\
decision.\

\f0\b 1.102-4 Acquisition Team.\

\f1\b0 The purpose of defining the Federal Acquisition Team (Team) in the Guiding Principles is to ensure that participants in the System are identified beginning with the customer and ending with the contractor of the product or service. By identifying\

\f1\b0 the team members in this manner, teamwork, unity of purpose, and open communication among the members of the Team in sharing the vision and achieving the goal of the System are encouraged. Individual team members will participate in the acquisition process at the appropriate time.\

\f0\b 1.102-5 Role of the Acquisition Team.\

\f1\b0 (a) Government members of the Team must be empowered to make acquisition decisions within their areas of responsibility, including selection, negotiation, and administration of contracts consistent with the Guiding Principles. In particular, the contracting officer must have the authority to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with law, to determine the application of rules, regulations, and policies, on a specific contract.\
(b) The authority to make decisions and the accountability for the decisions made will be delegated to the lowest level within the System, consistent with law.\
(c) The Team must be prepared to perform the functions and duties assigned. The Government is committed to provide training, professional development, and other resources necessary for maintaining and improving the knowledge, skills, and abilities for all Government participants on the Team, both with regard to their particular area of responsibility within the System, and their respective role as a team member. The contractor community is encouraged to do likewise.\
(d) The System will foster cooperative relationships between the Government and its contractors consistent with its overriding responsibility to the taxpayers.\
(e) The FAR outlines procurement policies and procedures that are used by members of the Acquisition Team. If a policy or procedure, or a particular strategy or practice, is in the best interest of the Government and is not specifically addressed in the FAR, nor prohibited by law (statute or case law), Executive order or other regulation, Government members of the Team should not assume it is prohibited. Rather, absence of direction should be interpreted as permitting the Team to innovate and use sound business judgment that is otherwise consistent with law and within the limits of their authority. Contracting officers should take the lead in encouraging business process innovations and ensuring that business decisions are sound.\

\f0\b 1.103 Authority.\

\f1\b0 (a) The development of the FAR System is in accordance with the requirements of \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 13\cf4 , Acquisition Councils.\
(b) The FAR is prepared, issued, and maintained, and the FAR System is prescribed jointly by the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under their several statutory authorities.\

\f0\b 1.104 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 The FAR applies to all acquisitions as defined in \cf3 part 2 \cf4 of the FAR, except where expressly excluded.\

\f0\b 1.105 Issuance.\
1.105-1 Publication and code arrangement.\

\f1\b0 (a) The FAR is published in\'97\

(2) Cumulated form in the 
\f2\i Code of Federal Regulations 
\f1\i0 (CFR); and\
(3) A separate edition available at \cf3 https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far\cf4 .\
(b) The FAR is issued as Chapter 1 of Title 48, CFR. Subsequent chapters are reserved for agency acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR (see \cf3 subpart 1.3\cf4 ). The CFR Staff will assign chapter numbers to requesting agencies. (c) Each numbered unit or segment (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 part, subpart, section, etc.) of an agency acquisition regulation that is codified in\
the CFR shall begin with the chapter number. However, the chapter number assigned to the FAR will not be included in the numbered units or segments of the FAR.\

\f0\b 1.105-2 Arrangement of regulations.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General. 
\f1\i0 The FAR is divided into subchapters, parts (each of which covers a separate aspect of acquisition), subparts, sections, and subsections.\
(b) Numbering. (1) The numbering system permits the discrete identification of every FAR paragraph. The digits to the left of the decimal point represent the part number. The numbers to the right of the decimal point and to the left of the dash represent, in order, the subpart (one or two digits), and the section (two digits). The number to the right of the dash represents\

(a) The certification requirement is specifically imposed by statute; or\
(b) Written justification for such certification is provided to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, and the Administrator approves in writing the inclusion of such certification requirement.\

\f0\b 1.108 FAR conventions.\

\f1\b0 The following conventions provide guidance for interpreting the FAR:\
(a) 
\f2\i Words and terms
\f1\i0 . Definitions in \cf3 part 2 \cf4 apply to the entire regulation unless specifically defined in another part, subpart, section, provision, or clause. Words or terms defined in a specific part, subpart, section, provision, or clause have that meaning when used in that part, subpart, section, provision, or clause. Undefined words retain their common dictionary meaning.\
(b) 
\f2\i Delegation of authority
\f1\i0 . Each authority is delegable unless specifically stated otherwise (see \cf3 1.102-5\cf4 (b)).\
(c) 
\f2\i Dollar thresholds
\f1\i0 . Unless otherwise specified, a specific dollar threshold for the purpose of applicability is the final anticipated dollar value of the action, including the dollar value of all options. If the action establishes a maximum quantity of supplies or services to be acquired or establishes a ceiling price or establishes the final price to be based on future events, the final anticipated dollar value must be the highest final priced alternative to the Government, including the dollar value of all options.\
(d) 
\f2\i Application of FAR changes to solicitations and contracts
\f1\i0 . Unless otherwise specified-\
(1) FAR changes apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the change;\
(2) Contracting officers may, at their discretion, include the FAR changes in solicitations issued before the effective\
date, provided award of the resulting contract(s) occurs on or after the effective date; and\
(3) Contracting officers may, at their discretion, include the changes in any existing contract with appropriate\
consideration.\
(e) 
\f2\i Citations
\f1\i0 . When the FAR cites a statute, Executive order, Office of Management and Budget circular, Office of Federal\
Procurement Policy policy letter, or relevant portion of the 
\f2\i Code of Federal Regulations
\f1\i0 , the citation includes all applicable amendments, unless otherwise stated.\
(f) 
\f2\i Imperative sentences
\f1\i0 . When an imperative sentence directs action, the contracting officer is responsible for the action, unless another party is expressly cited.\

\f0\b\fs20 1.109 Statutory acquisition\'96related dollar thresholds-adjustment for inflation.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1908 \cf4 requires that the FAR Council periodically adjust all statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds in the FAR for inflation, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This adjustment is calculated every 5 years, starting in October 2005, using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), and supersedes the applicability of any other provision of law that provides for the adjustment of such acquisition-related dollar thresholds.\
(b) The statute defines an acquisition-related dollar threshold as a dollar threshold that is specified in law as a factor in defining the scope of the applicability of a policy, procedure, requirement, or restriction provided in that law to the procurement of supplies or services by an executive agency, as determined by the FAR Council.\
(c) The statute does not permit escalation of acquisition-related dollar thresholds established by: (1) \cf3 40 U.S.C. chapter 31\cf4 \'97\
(i) Subchapter III, Bonds; and\
(ii) Subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction);\
(2) \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 67\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards; or\
(3) The United States Trade Representative pursuant to the authority of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (\cf3 19 U.S.C.\
2511 et seq.\cf4 ).\
(d) The statute, as amended by section 821 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L.\
115-91), requires the adjustment described in paragraph (a) of this section be applied to contracts and subcontracts without regard to the date of award of the contract or subcontract. Therefore, if a threshold is adjusted for inflation as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, then the changed threshold applies throughout the remaining term of the contract, unless there is a subsequent threshold adjustment.\
(e) A matrix showing calculation of the most recent escalation adjustments of statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds is available via the Internet at \cf3 http://www.regulations.gov \cf4 (search FAR Case 2019-013, open the docket folder, and go to the supporting documents file).\

\fs20 1.301 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Subject to the authorities in paragraph (c) of this section and other statutory authority, an agency head may issue or authorize the issuance of agency acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR and incorporate, together with the FAR, agency policies, procedures, contract clauses, solicitation provisions, and forms that govern the contracting process or otherwise control the relationship between the agency, including any of its suborganizations, and contractors or prospective contractors.\
(2) Subject to the authorities in paragraph (c) of this section and other statutory authority, an agency head may issue or authorize the issuance of internal agency guidance at any organizational level (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 designations and delegations of authority, assignments of responsibilities, work-flow procedures, and internal reporting requirements).\
(b) 
\f2\i Agency heads shall establish procedures to ensure that agency acquisition regulations are published for comment\
in the Federal Register 
\f1\i0 in conformance with the procedures in \cf3 subpart 1.5 \cf4 and as required by \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1707\cf4 , and other applicable statutes, when they have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency or have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. However, publication is not required for issuances that merely implement or supplement higher level issuances that have previously undergone the public comment process, unless such implementation or supplementation results in an additional significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors or effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the issuing organization. Issuances under \cf3 1.301\cf4 (a)(2) need not be publicized for public comment.\
(c) When adopting acquisition regulations, agencies shall ensure that they comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act (\cf3 44 U.S.C.3501\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq.
\f1\i0 ) as implemented in 5 CFR1320 (see \cf3 1.106\cf4 ) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C.601\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq.
\f1\i0 ). Normally, when a law requires publication of a proposed regulation, the Regulatory Flexibility Act applies and agencies must prepare written analyses, or certifications as provided in the law.\
(d) Agency acquisition regulations implementing or supplementing the FAR are, for-\
(1) The military departments and defense agencies, issued subject to the authority of the Secretary of Defense;\
(2) NASA activities, issued subject to the authorities of the Administrator of NASA; and\
(3) The civilian agencies other than NASA, issued by the heads of those agencies subject to the overall authority of the\
Administrator of General Services or independent authority the agency may have.\

\f0\b 1.302 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 Agency acquisition regulations shall be limited to-\
(a) Those necessary to implement FAR policies and procedures within the agency; and\
(b) Additional policies, procedures, solicitation provisions, or contract clauses that supplement the FAR to satisfy the\
specific needs of the agency.\

\f0\b 1.303 Publication and codification.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agency-wide acquisition regulations shall be published in the 
\f2\i Federal Register 
\f1\i0 as required by law, shall be codified under an assigned chapter in Title 48, 
\f2\i Code of Federal Regulations
\f1\i0 , and shall parallel the FAR in format, arrangement,\
and numbering system (but see \cf3 1.105-1\cf4 (c)). Coverage in an agency acquisition regulation that implements a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR shall be numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and title. Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR shall be codified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of 70 and up (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 for the Department of Interior, whose assigned chapter number in Title 48 is 14, Part 1470, Subpart 1401.70, section 1401.370, or subsection 1401.301-70).\
(b) Issuances under \cf3 1.301\cf4 (a)(2) need not be published in the 
\f2\i Federal Register
\f1\i0 .\

\f0\b 1.304 Agency control and compliance procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Under the authorities of \cf3 1.301\cf4 (d), agencies shall control and limit issuance of agency acquisition regulations and, in particular, local agency directives that restrain the flexibilities found in the FAR, and shall establish formal procedures for the review of these documents to assure compliance with this \cf3 part 1\cf4 .\
(b) Agency acquisition regulations shall not-\
(1) Unnecessarily repeat, paraphrase, or otherwise restate material contained in the FAR or higher-level agency\
acquisition regulations; or\
(2) Except as required by law or as provided in \cf3 subpart 1.4\cf4 , conflict or be inconsistent with FAR content.\

\fs20 FAR 
\f0\b 1.404\

\fs24 Subpart 1.4 - Deviations from the FAR\

\fs20 1.400 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures for authorizing deviations from the FAR. Exceptions pertaining to the use of forms prescribed by the FAR are covered in \cf3 part 53 \cf4 rather than in this subpart.\

\f0\b 1.401 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Deviation 
\f1\i0 means any one or combination of the following:\
(a) The issuance or use of a policy, procedure, solicitation provision (see definition in \cf3 2.101\cf4 ), contract clause (see definition in \cf3 2.101\cf4 ), method, or practice of conducting acquisition actions of any kind at any stage of the acquisition process that is inconsistent with the FAR.\
(b) The omission of any solicitation provision or contract clause when its prescription requires its use.\
(c) The use of any solicitation provision or contract clause with modified or alternate language that is not authorized by the FAR (see definition of "modification" in \cf3 52.101\cf4 (a) and definition of "alternate" in \cf3 2.101\cf2 ).\
(d) The use of a solicitation provision or contract clause prescribed by the FAR on a "substantially as follows" or "substantially the same as" basis (see definitions in \cf3 2.101 \cf4 and \cf3 52.101\cf4 (a)), if such use is inconsistent with the intent, principle, or substance of the prescription or related coverage on the subject matter in the FAR.\
(e) The authorization of lesser or greater limitations on the use of any solicitation provision, contract clause, policy, or procedure prescribed by the FAR.\
(f) The issuance of policies or procedures that govern the contracting process or otherwise control contracting relationships that are not incorporated into agency acquisition regulations in accordance with \cf3 1.301\cf4 (a).\

\f0\b 1.402 Policy.\

\f1\b0 Unless precluded by law, executive order, or regulation, deviations from the FAR may be granted as specified in this subpart when necessary to meet the specific needs and requirements of each agency. The development and testing of new techniques and methods of acquisition should not be stifled simply because such action would require a FAR deviation.\
The fact that deviation authority is required should not, of itself, deter agencies in their development and testing of new techniques and acquisition methods. Refer to \cf3 31.101 \cf4 for instructions concerning deviations pertaining to the subject matter of \cf3 part 31\cf4 , Contract Cost Principles and Procedures. Deviations are not authorized with respect to \cf3 30.201-3 \cf4 and \cf3 30.201-4\cf4 , or the requirements of the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) rules and regulations (48 CFR chapter 99). Refer to \cf3 30.201-5 \cf4 for instructions concerning waivers pertaining to Cost Accounting Standards.\

\f0\b 1.403 Individual deviations.\

\f1\b0 Individual deviations affect only one contract action, and, unless \cf3 1.405\cf4 (e) is applicable, may be authorized by the agency head. The contracting officer must document the justification and agency approval in the contract file.\

\f0\b 1.404 Class deviations.\

\f1\b0 Class deviations affect more than one contract action. When an agency knows that it will require a class deviation on a permanent basis, it should propose a FAR revision, if appropriate. Civilian agencies, other than NASA, must furnish a copy of each approved class deviation to the FAR Secretariat.\
(a) For civilian agencies except NASA, class deviations may be authorized by agency heads or their designees, unless \cf3 1.405\cf4 (e) is applicable. Delegation of this authority shall not be made below the head of a contracting activity. Authorization of class deviations by agency officials is subject to the following limitations:\
(1) An agency official who may authorize a class deviation, before doing so, shall consult with the chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAA Council), unless that agency official determines that urgency precludes such consultation.\
(2) Recommended revisions to the FAR shall be transmitted to the FAR Secretariat by agency heads or their designees for authorizing class deviations.\
(b) For DoD, class deviations shall be controlled, processed, and approved in accordance with the Defense FAR Supplement.\
(c) For NASA, class deviations shall be controlled and approved by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement. Deviations shall be processed in accordance with agency regulations.\

\f1\b0 (a) "Executive agreements," as used in this section, means Government-to-Government agreements, including agreements with international organizations, to which the United States is a party.\
(b) Any deviation from the FAR required to comply with a treaty to which the United States is a party is authorized, unless the deviation would be inconsistent with FAR coverage based on a law enacted after the execution of the treaty.\
(c) Any deviation from the FAR required to comply with an executive agreement is authorized unless the deviation would be inconsistent with FAR coverage based on law.\
(d) For civilian agencies other than NASA, a copy of the text deviation authorized under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be transmitted to the FAR Secretariat through a central agency control point.\
(e) For civilian agencies other than NASA, if a deviation required to comply with a treaty or an executive agreement is not authorized by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, then the request for deviation shall be processed through the FAR Secretariat to the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council.\

1.501-1 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Significant revisions
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means revisions that alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in the FAR System and which have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors, or significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the issuing agency. This expression, for example, does not include editorial, stylistic, or other revisions that have no impact on the basic meaning of the coverage being revised.\

\f0\b 1.501-2 Opportunity for public comments.\

\f1\b0 (a) Views of agencies and nongovernmental parties or organizations will be considered in formulating acquisition policies and procedures.\
(b) The opportunity to submit written comments on proposed significant revisions shall be provided by placing a notice in the 
\f2\i Federal Register
\f1\i0 . Each of these notices shall include-\
(1) The text of the revision or, if it is impracticable to publish the full text, a summary of the proposal;\
(2) The address and telephone number of the individual from whom copies of the revision, in full text, can be requested and to whom comments thereon should be addressed; and\
(3) When \cf3 1.501-3\cf4 (b) is applicable, a statement that the revision is effective on a temporary basis pending completion of the public comment period.\
(c) A minimum of 30 days and, normally, at least 60 days will be given for the receipt of comments.\

\f0\b 1.501-3 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) Comments need not be solicited when the proposed coverage does not constitute a significant revision.\
(b) Advance comments need not be solicited when urgent and compelling circumstances make solicitation of comments impracticable prior to the effective date of the coverage, such as when a new statute must be implemented in a relatively short period of time. In such case, the coverage shall be issued on a temporary basis and shall provide for at least a 30 day public comment period.\

\f0\b 1.502 Unsolicited proposed revisions.\

\f1\b0 Consideration shall also be given to unsolicited recommendations for revisions that have been submitted in writing with sufficient data and rationale to permit their evaluation.\

\f0\b 1.503 Public meetings.\

\f1\b0 Public meetings may be appropriate when a decision to adopt, amend, or delete FAR coverage is likely to benefit from significant additional views and discussion.\

\fs24 Subpart 1.6 - Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities\

\fs20 1.601 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unless specifically prohibited by another provision of law, authority and responsibility to contract for authorized supplies and services are vested in the agency head. The agency head may establish contracting activities and delegate broad authority to manage the agency\'92s contracting functions to heads of such contracting activities. Contracts may be entered into and signed on behalf of the Government only by contracting officers. In some agencies, a relatively small number of high level officials are designated contracting officers solely by virtue of their positions. Contracting officers below the level of a head of a contracting activity shall be selected and appointed under \cf3 1.603\cf4 .\
(b) Agency heads may mutually agree to-\
(1) Assign contracting functions and responsibilities from one agency to another; and\
(2) Create joint or combined offices to exercise acquisition functions and responsibilities.\

\f0\b 1.602 Contracting officers.\
1.602-1 Authority.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers have authority to enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings. Contracting officers may bind the Government only to the extent of the authority delegated to them. Contracting officers shall receive from the appointing authority (see \cf3 1.603-1\cf4 ) clear instructions in writing regarding the limits of their authority. Information on the limits of the contracting officers\'92 authority shall be readily available to the public and agency personnel.\
(b) No contract shall be entered into unless the contracting officer ensures that all requirements of law, executive orders, regulations, and all other applicable procedures, including clearances and approvals, have been met.\

\f0\b 1.602-2 Responsibilities.\

\f0\b 1.702 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) A D&F shall ordinarily be for an individual contract action. Unless otherwise prohibited, class D&F\'92s may be executed for classes of contract actions (see \cf3 1.703\cf4 ). The approval granted by a D&F is restricted to the proposed contract action(s) reasonably described in that D&F. D&F\'92s may provide for a reasonable degree of flexibility. Furthermore, in their application, reasonable variations in estimated quantities or prices are permitted, unless the D&F specifies otherwise.\
(b) When an option is anticipated, the D&F shall state the approximate quantity to be awarded initially and the extent of the increase to be permitted by the option.\

\f0\b 1.703 Class determinations and findings.\

\f1\b0 (a) A class D&F provides authority for a class of contract actions. A class may consist of contract actions for the same or related supplies or services or other contract actions that require essentially identical justification.\
(b) The findings in a class D&F shall fully support the proposed action either for the class as a whole or for each action. A class D&F shall be for a specified period, with the expiration date stated in the document.\
(c) The contracting officer shall ensure that individual actions taken pursuant to the authority of a class D&F are within the scope of the D&F.\

\f0\b 1.704 Content.\

\f1\b0 Each D&F shall set forth enough facts and circumstances to clearly and convincingly justify the specific determination made. As a minimum, each D&F shall include, in the prescribed agency format, the following information:\
(a) Identification of the agency and of the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a "Determination and Findings."\
(b) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.\
(c) Citation of the appropriate statute and/or regulation upon which the D&F is based.\
(d) Findings that detail the particular circumstances, facts, or reasoning essential to support the determination. Necessary\
supporting documentation shall be obtained from appropriate requirements and technical personnel.\
(e) A determination, based on the findings, that the proposed action is justified under the applicable statute or regulation. (f) Expiration date of the D&F, if required (see \cf3 1.706\cf4 ).\
(g) The signature of the official authorized to sign the D&F (see \cf3 1.707\cf4 ) and the date signed.\

\f0\b 1.705 Supersession and modification.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a D&F is superseded by another D&F, that action shall not render invalid any action taken under the original D&F prior to the date of its supersession.\
(b) The contracting officer need not cancel the solicitation if the D&F, as modified, supports the contract action.\

\f0\b 1.706 Expiration.\

\f1\b0 Expiration dates are required for class D&F\'92s and are optional for individual D&F\'92s. Authority to act under an individual D&F expires when it is exercised or on an expiration date specified in the document, whichever occurs first. Authority to act under a class D&F expires on the expiration date specified in the document. When a solicitation has been furnished to prospective offerors before the expiration date, the authority under the D&F will continue until award of the contract(s) resulting from the solicitation.\

 3.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures for avoiding improper business practices and personal conflicts of interest and for dealing with their apparent or actual occurrence.\

\f0\b 3.101 Standards of conduct.\
3.101-1 General.\

\fs24 Subpart 3.1 - Safeguards\

\f1\b0\fs20 Government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach and, except as authorized by statute or regulation, with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none. Transactions relating to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust and an impeccable standard of conduct. The general rule is to avoid strictly any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in Government-contractor relationships. While many Federal laws and regulations place restrictions on the actions of Government personnel, their official conduct must, in addition, be such that they would have no reluctance to make a full public disclosure of their actions.\

\f0\b 3.101-2 Solicitation and acceptance of gratuities by Government personnel.\

\f1\b0 As a rule, no Government employee may solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gratuity, gift, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from anyone who (a) has or is seeking to obtain Government business with the employee\'92s agency, (b) conducts activities that are regulated by the employee\'92s agency, or (c) has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee\'92s official duties. Certain limited exceptions are authorized in agency regulations.\

\f0\b 3.101-3 Agency regulations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies are required by Executive Order 11222 of May 8,1965, and 5 CFR 735 to prescribe "Standards of Conduct." These agency standards contain-\
(1) Agency-authorized exceptions to \cf3 3.101-2\cf4 ; and\
(2) Disciplinary measures for persons violating the standards of conduct.\
(b) Requirements for employee financial disclosure and restrictions on private employment for former Government\
employees are in Office of Personnel Management and agency regulations implementing Public Law 95-521, which amended \cf3 18 U.S.C.207\cf4 .\

\f0\b 3.102 [Reserved]\
3.103 Independent pricing.\
3.103-1 Solicitation provision.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.203-2\cf4 , Certificate of Independent Price Determination, in solicitations when a firm-fixed-price contract or fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment is contemplated, unless-\
(a) The acquisition is to be made under the simplified acquisition procedures in \cf3 part 13\cf4 ;\
(b) [Reserved]\
(c) The solicitation is a request for technical proposals under two-step sealed bidding procedures; or (d) The solicitation is for utility services for which rates are set by law or regulation.\

\f0\b 3.103-2 Evaluating the certification.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Evaluation guidelines
\f1\i0 . (1) None of the following, in and of itself, constitutes "disclosure" as it is used in paragraph (a) (2) of the Certificate of Independent Price Determination (hereafter, the certificate):\
(i) The fact that a firm has published price lists, rates, or tariffs covering items being acquired by the Government.\
(ii) The fact that a firm has informed prospective customers of proposed or pending publication of new or revised price lists for items being acquired by the Government.\
(iii) The fact that a firm has sold the same items to commercial customers at the same prices being offered to the Government.\

\fs20 (2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of the certificate, an individual may use a blanket authorization to act as an agent for the person(s) responsible for determining the offered prices if-\
(i) The proposed contract to which the certificate applies is clearly within the scope of the authorization; and\
(ii) The person giving the authorization is the person within the offeror\'92s organization who is responsible for determining the prices being offered at the time the certification is made in the particular offer.\
(3) If an offer is submitted jointly by two or more concerns, the certification provided by the representative of each concern applies only to the activities of that concern.\
(b) Rejection of offers suspected of being collusive. (1) If the offeror deleted or modified paragraph (a)(1) or (3) or paragraph (b) of the certificate, the contracting officer shall reject the offeror\'92s bid or proposal.\
(2) If the offeror deleted or modified paragraph (a)(2) of the certificate, the offeror must have furnished with its offer a signed statement of the circumstances of the disclosure of prices contained in the bid or proposal. The chief of the contracting office shall review the altered certificate and the statement and shall determine, in writing, whether the disclosure was made for the purpose or had the effect of restricting competition. If the determination is positive, the bid or proposal shall be rejected; if it is negative, the bid or proposal shall be considered for award.\
(3) Whenever an offer is rejected under paragraph (b)(1) or (2)of this section, or the certificate is suspected of being false, the contracting officer shall report the situation to the Attorney General in accordance with \cf3 3.303\cf4 .\
(4) The determination made under paragraph (2) of this section shall not prevent or inhibit the prosecution of any criminal or civil actions involving the occurrences or transactions to which the certificate relates.\

\f0\b 3.103-3 The need for further certifications.\

\f1\b0 A contractor that properly executed the certificate before award does not have to submit a separate certificate with each proposal to perform a work order or similar ordering instrument issued pursuant to the terms of the contract, where the Government\'92s requirements cannot be met from another source.\

\f0\b 3.104 Procurement integrity.\

(1) Cost or pricing data (as defined by \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3701(1) \cf4 with respect to procurements subject to that section, and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3501(a)(1)\cf4 , with respect to procurements subject to that section.\
(2) Indirect costs and direct labor rates.\
(3) Proprietary information about manufacturing processes, operations, or techniques marked by the contractor in accordance with applicable law or regulation.\
(4) Information marked by the contractor as "contractor bid or proposal information" in accordance with applicable law or regulation.\

\f2\i Decision to award a subcontract or modification of subcontract 
\f1\i0 means a decision to designate award to a particular\
source.\

\f2\i Federal agency procurement 
\f1\i0 means the acquisition (by using competitive procedures and awarding a contract) of goods or\
services (including construction) from non-Federal sources by a Federal agency using appropriated funds.

\f2\i\b0 In excess of $10,000,000 
\f1\i0 means\'96\
(1) The value, or estimated value, at the time of award, of the contract, including all options;\
(2) The total estimated value at the time of award of all orders under an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, or\
requirements contract;\
(3) Any multiple award schedule contract, unless the contracting officer documents a lower estimate;\
(4) The value of a delivery order, task order, or an order under a Basic Ordering Agreement;\
(5) The amount paid or to be paid in settlement of a claim; or\
(6) The estimated monetary value of negotiated overhead or other rates when applied to the Government portion of the\
applicable allocation base. 
\f2\i Official 
\f1\i0 means\'96\
(1) An officer, as defined in \cf3 5 U.S.C.2104\cf4 ;\
(2) An employee, as defined in \cf3 5 U.S.C.2105\cf4 ;\
(3) A member of the uniformed services, as defined in \cf3 5 U.S.C.2101(3)\cf4 ; or (4) A special Government employee, as defined in \cf3 18 U.S.C.202\cf4 .\

\f2\i Participating personally and substantially in a Federal agency procurement 
\f1\i0 means\'96\
(1) Active and significant involvement of an official in any of the following activities directly related to that\
procurement:\
(i) Drafting, reviewing, or approving the specification or statement of work for the procurement.: (ii) Preparing or developing the solicitation.\
(iii) Evaluating bids or proposals, or selecting a source.\
(iv) Negotiating price or terms and conditions of the contract.\
(v) Reviewing and approving the award of the contract.\
(2) "Participating personally" means participating directly, and includes the direct and active supervision of a subordinate's participation in the matter.\
(3) "Participating substantially" means that the official's involvement is of significance to the matter. Substantial participation requires more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrative or peripheral issue. Participation may be substantial even though it is not determinative of the outcome of a particular matter. A finding of substantiality should be based not only on the effort devoted to a matter, but on the importance of the effort. While a series of peripheral involvements may be insubstantial, the single act of approving or participating\
in a critical step may be substantial. However, the review of procurement documents solely to determine compliance with regulatory, administrative, or budgetary procedures, does not constitute substantial participation in a procurement.\
(4) Generally, an official will not be considered to have participated personally and substantially in a procurement solely by participating in the following activities:\
(i) Agency-level boards, panels, or other advisory committees that review program milestones or evaluate and make recommendations regarding alternative technologies or approaches for satisfying broad agency-level missions or objectives.\
(ii) The performance of general, technical, engineering, or scientific effort having broad application not directly associated with a particular procurement, notwithstanding that such general, technical, engineering, or scientific effort subsequently may be incorporated into a particular procurement.\
(iii) Clerical functions supporting the conduct of a particular procurement.\
(iv) For procurements to be conducted under the procedures of OMB Circular A-76, participation in management studies, preparation of in-house cost estimates, preparation of "most efficient organization" analyses, and furnishing of data or technical support to be used by others in the development of performance standards, statements of work, or specifications.\

\f2\i Source selection evaluation board 
\f1\i0 means any board, team, council, or other group that evaluates bids or proposals.\

\f0\b 3.104-2 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) This section implements \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 21\cf4 , Restrictions on Obtaining and Disclosing Certain Information. Agency supplementation of \cf3 3.104\cf4 , including specific definitions to identify individuals who occupy positions specified in \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (d) (1)(ii), and any clauses required by \cf3 3.104 \cf4 must be approved by the senior procurement executive of the agency, unless a law establishes a higher level of approval for that agency.\
(b) Agency officials are reminded that there are other statutes and regulations that deal with the same or related prohibited conduct, for example-\
(1) The offer or acceptance of a bribe or gratuity is prohibited by \cf3 18 U.S.C. 201 \cf4 and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 4651\cf4 . The acceptance of a gift, under certain circumstances, is prohibited by \cf3 5 U.S.C. 7353 \cf4 and 5 CFR Part 2635;\

\fs20 (2) Contacts with an offeror during the conduct of an acquisition may constitute "seeking employment," (see Subpart\
F of 5 CFR Part 2636 and \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (c)(2)). Government officers and employees (employees) are prohibited by \cf3 18 U.S.C. 208 \cf4 and 5 CFR Part 2635 from participating personally and substantially in any particular matter that would affect the financial interests of any person with whom the employee is seeking employment. An employee who engages in negotiations or is otherwise seeking employment with an offeror or who has an arrangement concerning future employment with an offeror must comply with the applicable disqualification requirements of 5 CFR 2635.604 and 2635.606. The statutory prohibition in \cf3 18 U.S.C. 208 \cf4 also may require an employee\'92s disqualification from participation in the acquisition even if the employee\'92s duties may not be considered "participating personally and substantially," as this term is defined in \cf3 3.104-1\cf4 ;\
(3) Post-employment restrictions are covered by \cf3 18 U.S.C. 207 \cf4 and 5 CFR parts 2637 and 2641, that prohibit certain activities by former Government employees, including representation of a contractor before the Government in relation to any contract or other particular matter involving specific parties on which the former employee participated personally and substantially while employed by the Government. Additional restrictions apply to certain senior Government employees and for particular matters under an employee\'92s official responsibility;\
(4) \cf3 parts 14 \cf4 and \cf3 15 \cf4 place restrictions on the release of information related to procurements and other contractor information that must be protected under \cf3 18 U.S.C. 1905\cf4 ;\
(5) Release of information both before and after award (see \cf3 3.104-4\cf4 ) may be prohibited by the Privacy Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C. 552a\cf4 ), the Trade Secrets Act (\cf3 18 U.S.C. 1905\cf4 ), and other laws; and\
(6) Using nonpublic information to further an employee\'92s private interest or that of another and engaging in a financial transaction using nonpublic information are prohibited by 5 CFR 2635.703.\

\f0\b 3.104-3 Statutory and related prohibitions, restrictions, and requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Prohibition on disclosing procurement information(\cf3 41 U.S.C. 2102\cf4 ). (1) A person described in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection must not, other than as provided by law, knowingly disclose contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information before the award of a Federal agency procurement contract to which the information relates. (See \cf3 3.104-4\cf4 (a).)\
(2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection applies to any person who-\
(i) Is a present or former official of the United States, or a person who is acting or has acted for or on behalf of, or\
who is advising or has advised the United States with respect to, a Federal agency procurement; and\
(ii) By virtue of that office, employment, or relationship, has or had access to contractor bid or proposal information\

(i) Promptly report the contact in writing to the official\'92s supervisor and to the agency ethics official; and\
(ii) Either reject the possibility of non-Federal employment or disqualify himself or herself from further personal and substantial participation in that Federal agency procurement (see \cf3 3.104-5\cf4 ) until such time as the agency authorizes the official to resume participation in that procurement, in accordance with the requirements of \cf3 18 U.S.C. 208 \cf4 and applicable agency regulations, because-\
(A) The person is no longer an offeror in that Federal agency procurement; or\

\f0\b 3.104-4 Disclosure, protection, and marking of contractor bid or proposal information and source selection information.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as specifically provided for in this subsection, no person or other entity may disclose contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information to any person other than a person authorized, in accordance with applicable agency regulations or procedures, by the agency head or the contracting officer to receive such information.\

\f2\i "Source Selection Information-See FAR 
\f1\i0 \cf3 2.101 
\f2\i \cf4 and \cf3 3.104\cf4 ." 
\f1\i0 Although the information in paragraphs (1) through (9) of the definition in \cf3 2.101 \cf4 is considered to be source selection information whether or not marked, all reasonable efforts must be made to mark such material with the same legend.\
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, the contracting officer must notify the contractor in writing if the contracting officer believes that proprietary information, contractor bid or proposal information, or information marked in accordance with \cf3 52.215-1\cf4 (e) has been inappropriately marked.

(1) If the contractor agrees that the marking is not justified, or does not respond within the time specified in the notice, the contracting officer may remove the marking and release the information.\

(3) For technical data marked as proprietary by a contractor, the contracting officer must follow the procedures in \cf3 27.404-5\cf4 .\
(e) This section does not restrict or prohibit-\
(1) A contractor from disclosing its own bid or proposal information or the recipient from receiving that information; (2) The disclosure or receipt of information, not otherwise protected, relating to a Federal agency procurement after it\
has been canceled by the Federal agency, before contract award, unless the Federal agency plans to resume the procurement; (3) Individual meetings between a Federal agency official and an offeror or potential offeror for, or a recipient of, a\

(2) The withholding of information from, or restricting its receipt by, the Comptroller General in the course of a protest against the award or proposed award of a Federal agency procurement contract;\
(3) The release of information after award of a contract or cancellation of a procurement if such information is contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information that pertains to another procurement; or\
(4) The disclosure, solicitation, or receipt of bid or proposal information or source selection information after award if disclosure, solicitation, or receipt is prohibited by law. (See \cf3 3.104-2\cf4 (b)(5) and \cf3 subpart 24.2\cf4 .)\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Contacts through agents or other intermediaries
\f1\i0 . Employment contacts between the employee and the offeror, that are conducted through agents, or other intermediaries, may require disqualification under \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (c)(1).

(b) 
\f2\i Disqualification notice
\f1\i0 . In addition to submitting the contact report required by \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (c)(1), an agency official who must disqualify himself or herself pursuant to \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (c)(1)(ii) must promptly submit written notice of disqualification from further participation in the procurement to the contracting officer, the source selection authority if other than the contracting officer, and the agency official\'92s immediate supervisor.

(2) After the conditions of \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (c)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) have been met, the head of the contracting activity (HCA), after consultation with the agency ethics official, may authorize the disqualified official to resume participation in the procurement, or may determine that an additional disqualification period is necessary to protect the integrity of the procurement process.\
In determining the disqualification period, the HCA must consider any factors that create an appearance that the disqualified official acted without complete impartiality in the procurement. The HCA\'92s reinstatement decision should be in writing.\
(3) Government officer or employee must also comply with the provisions of \cf3 18 U.S.C.208 \cf4 and 5 CFR part 2635 regarding any resumed participation in a procurement matter. Government officer or employee may not be reinstated to participate in a procurement matter affecting the financial interest of someone with whom the individual is seeking employment, unless the individual receives-\
(i) A waiver pursuant to \cf3 18 U.S.C.208(b)(1) \cf4 or (b)(3); or\
(ii) An authorization in accordance with the requirements of subpart F of 5 CFR part 2635.\

(b) The request for an advisory opinion must be in writing, include all relevant information reasonably available to the official or former official, and be dated and signed. The request must include information about the-\
(1) Procurement(s), or decision(s) on matters under \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 (d)(1)(iii), involving the particular contractor, in which the individual was or is involved, including contract or solicitation numbers, dates of solicitation or award, a description of the supplies or services procured or to be procured, and contract amount;\
(2) Individual\'92s participation in the procurement or decision, including the dates or time periods of that participation, and the nature of the individual\'92s duties, responsibilities, or actions; and\

(c) Within 30 days after receipt of a request containing complete information, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the agency ethics official should issue an opinion on whether the proposed conduct would violate \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2104\cf4 .\
(d) (1) If complete information is not included in the request, the agency ethics official may ask the requester to provide more information or request information from other persons, including the source selection authority, the contracting officer, or the requester\'92s immediate supervisor.\
(2) In issuing an opinion, the agency ethics official may rely upon the accuracy of information furnished by the requester or other agency sources, unless he or she has reason to believe that the information is fraudulent, misleading, or otherwise incorrect.\
(3) If the requester is advised in a written opinion by the agency ethics official that the requester may accept compensation from a particular contractor, and accepts such compensation in good faith reliance on that advisory opinion, then neither the requester nor the contractor will be found to have knowingly violated \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2104\cf4 . If the requester or the contractor has actual knowledge or reason to believe that the opinion is based upon fraudulent, misleading, or otherwise incorrect information, their reliance upon the opinion will not be deemed to be in good faith.\

\f0\b 3.104-7 Violations or possible violations.\

\f1\b0 (a) A contracting officer who receives or obtains information of a violation or possible violation of \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2102, 2103, or 2104 \cf4 (see \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 ) must determine if the reported violation or possible violation has any impact on the pending award or selection of the contractor.\

(c) Before concluding that an offeror, contractor, or person has violated \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 21\cf4 , the HCA may consider that the interests of the Government are best served by requesting information from appropriate parties regarding the violation or\
possible violation.\
(d) If the HCA concludes that \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 21 \cf4 has been violated, the HCA may direct the contracting officer to-\

\f0\b 3.104-8 Criminal and civil penalties, and further administrative remedies.\

\f1\b0 Criminal and civil penalties, and administrative remedies, may apply to conduct that violates \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 21 \cf4 (see \cf3 3.104-3\cf4 ). See \cf3 33.102\cf4 (f) for special rules regarding bid protests. See \cf3 3.104-7 \cf4 for administrative remedies relating to contracts.\

(c) An official who refuses to terminate employment discussions (see \cf3 3.104-5\cf4 ) may be subject to agency administrative actions under 5 CFR 2635.604(d) if the official\'92s disqualification from participation in a particular procurement interferes substantially with the individual\'92s ability to perform assigned duties.\

\f0\b 3.202 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.203-3\cf4 , Gratuities, in solicitations and contracts with a value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except those for personal services and those between military departments or defense agencies and foreign governments that do not obligate any funds appropriated to the Department of Defense.\

\f0\b 3.203 Reporting suspected violations of the Gratuities clause.\

\f1\b0 Agency personnel shall report suspected violations of the Gratuities clause to the contracting officer or other designated official in accordance with agency procedures. The agency reporting procedures shall be published as an implementation of this section \cf3 3.203 \cf4 and shall clearly specify-\

\f0\b 3.204 Treatment of violations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Before taking any action against a contractor, the agency head or a designee shall determine, after notice and hearing under agency procedures, whether the contractor, its agent, or another representative, under a contract containing the Gratuities clause-\

\fs24 Subpart 3.3 - Reports of Suspected Antitrust Violations\

\fs20 3.301 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Practices that eliminate competition or restrain trade usually lead to excessive prices and may warrant criminal, civil, or administrative action against the participants. Examples of anticompetitive practices are collusive bidding, follow-the- leader pricing, rotated low bids, collusive price estimating systems, and sharing of the business.\
(b) Contracting personnel are an important potential source of investigative leads for antitrust enforcement and should therefore be sensitive to indications of unlawful behavior by offerors and contractors. Agency personnel shall report, in accordance with agency regulations, evidence of suspected antitrust violations in acquisitions for possible referral to-\
(1) The Attorney General under \cf3 3.303\cf4 ; and\
(2) The agency office responsible for contractor debarment and suspension under \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 .\

\f0\b 3.302 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Identical bids 
\f1\i0 means bids for the same line item that are determined to be identical as to unit price or total line item amount, with or without the application of evaluation factors (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 discount or transportation cost).\

\f0\b 3.303 Reporting suspected antitrust violations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies are required by \cf3 41 U.S.C.3707 \cf4 and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3307 \cf4 to report to the Attorney General any bids or proposals that evidence a violation of the antitrust laws. These reports are in addition to those required by \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 .\
(b) The antitrust laws are intended to ensure that markets operate competitively. Any agreement or mutual understanding among competing firms that restrains the natural operation of market forces is suspect. Paragraph (c) of this section identifies behavior patterns that are often associated with antitrust violations. Activities meeting the descriptions in paragraph (c) are not necessarily improper, but they are sufficiently questionable to warrant notifying the appropriate authorities, in accordance with agency procedures.\
(c) Practices or events that may evidence violations of the antitrust laws include-\
(1) The existence of an "industry price list" or "price agreement" to which contractors refer in formulating their offers; (2) A sudden change from competitive bidding to identical bidding;\
(3) Simultaneous price increases or follow-the-leader pricing;\
(4) Rotation of bids or proposals, so that each competitor takes a turn in sequence as low bidder, or so that certain\
competitors bid low only on some sizes of contracts and high on other sizes;\
(5) Division of the market, so that certain competitors bid low only for contracts awarded by certain agencies, or for\
contracts in certain geographical areas, or on certain products, and bid high on all other jobs;\
(6) Establishment by competitors of a collusive price estimating system;\
(7) The filing of a joint bid by two or more competitors when at least one of the competitors has sufficient technical\
capability and productive capacity for contract performance;\
(8) Any incidents suggesting direct collusion among competitors, such as the appearance of identical calculation or\
spelling errors in two or more competitive offers or the submission by one firm of offers for other firms; and\
(9) Assertions by the employees, former employees, or competitors of offerors, that an agreement to restrain trade\
exists.\
(d) Identical bids shall be reported under this section if the agency has some reason to believe that the bids resulted from\
collusion.\
(e) For offers from foreign contractors for contracts to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas,\
contracting officers may refer suspected collusive offers to the authorities of the foreign government concerned for appropriate action.\
(f) Agency reports shall be addressed to the- Attorney General\
U.S. Department of Justice\
Washington DC 20530\
Attention: Assistant Attorney General Antitrust Division\
and shall include-\
(1) A brief statement describing the suspected practice and the reason for the suspicion; and\

 3.400 Scope of subpart.\

\fs24 Subpart 3.4 - Contingent Fees\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures that restrict contingent fee arrangements for soliciting or obtaining Government contracts to those permitted by \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3321(b)(1) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3901\cf4 .\

\f0\b 3.401 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Bona fide agency 
\f1\i0 means an established commercial or selling agency, maintained by a contractor for the purpose of securing business, that neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds itself out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.\

\f2\i Bona fide employee 
\f1\i0 means a person, employed by a contractor and subject to the contractor\'92s supervision and control as to time, place, and manner of performance, who neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.\

\f2\i Contingent fee 
\f1\i0 means any commission, percentage, brokerage, or other fee that is contingent upon the success that a person or concern has in securing a Government contract.\

\f2\i Improper influence 
\f1\i0 means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Government employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Government contract on any basis other than the merits of the matter.\

\f0\b 3.402 Statutory requirements.\

\f1\b0 Contractors\'92 arrangements to pay contingent fees for soliciting or obtaining Government contracts have long been considered contrary to public policy because such arrangements may lead to attempted or actual exercise of improper influence. In \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3321(b) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3901\cf4 , Congress affirmed this public policy but permitted certain exceptions. These statutes-\
(a) Require in every negotiated contract a warranty by the contractor against contingent fees;\
(b) Permit, as an exception to the warranty, contingent fee arrangements between contractors and bona fide employees or bona fide agencies; and\
(c) Provide that, for breach or violation of the warranty by the contractor, the Government may annul the contract without liability or deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of the contingent fee.\

\f0\b 3.403 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 This subpart applies to all contracts. Statutory requirements for negotiated contracts are, as a matter of policy, extended to sealed bid contracts.\

\fs24 Subpart 3.5 - Other Improper Business Practices\

\f2\i\b0\fs20 Buying-in
\f1\i0 , as used in this section, means submitting an offer below anticipated costs, expecting to-\
(1) Increase the contract amount after award (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 through unnecessary or excessively priced change orders); or (2) Receive follow-on contracts at artificially high prices to recover losses incurred on the buy-in contract.\

\f0\b 3.501-2 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Buying-in may decrease competition or result in poor contract performance. The contracting officer must take appropriate action to ensure buying-in losses are not recovered by the contractor through the pricing of-\
(1) Change orders; or\
(2) Follow-on contracts subject to cost analysis.\
(b) The Government should minimize the opportunity for buying-in by seeking a price commitment covering as much of\
the entire program concerned as is practical by using-\
(1) Multiyear contracting, with a requirement in the solicitation that a price be submitted only for the total multi-year\
quantity; or\
(2) Priced options for additional quantities that, together with the firm contract quantity, equal the program\
requirements (see \cf3 subpart 17.2\cf4 ).\
(c) Other safeguards are available to the contracting officer to preclude recovery of buying-in losses (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 amortization\
of nonrecurring costs (see \cf3 15.408\cf4 , \cf3 Table 15-1\cf4 , paragraph A, column (2) under "Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries") and treatment of unreasonable price quotations (see \cf3 15.405\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 3.502-2 Subcontractor kickbacks.\

\f1\b0 The Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (now codified at 41 U.S.C. chapter 87, Kickbacks,) was passed to deter subcontractors from making payments and contractors from accepting payments for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment in connection with a prime contract or a subcontract relating to a prime contract. The Kickbacks statute-\
(a) Prohibits any person from-\
(1) Providing, attempting to provide, or offering to provide any kickback; (2) Soliciting, accepting, or attempting to accept any kickback; or\

\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 company ethics rules prohibiting kickbacks by employees, agents, or subcontractors; education programs for new employees and subcontractors, explaining policies about kickbacks, related company procedures and the consequences of detection; procurement procedures to minimize the opportunity\
for kickbacks; audit procedures designed to detect kickbacks; periodic surveys of subcontractors to elicit information\
about kickbacks; procedures to report kickbacks to law enforcement officials; annual declarations by employees of gifts\
or gratuities received from subcontractors; annual employee declarations that they have violated no company ethics\
rules; personnel practices that document unethical or illegal behavior and make such information available to prospective employers); and\
(2) Cooperate fully with any Federal agency investigating a possible violation of the Kickbacks statute.\
(j) Notwithstanding paragraph (i) of this section, a prime contractor shall cooperate fully with any Federal Government\
agency investigating a violation of \cf3 41 U.S.C. 8702 \cf4 (see \cf3 41 U.S.C. 8703(b)\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 3.503-2 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.203-6\cf4 , Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, in solicitations and contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.

\fs20 3.601 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as specified in \cf3 3.602\cf4 , a contracting officer shall not knowingly award a contract to a Government employee or to a business concern or other organization owned or substantially owned or controlled by one or more Government employees. This policy is intended to avoid any conflict of interest that might arise between the employees\'92 interests and their Government duties, and to avoid the appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment by the Government toward its employees.\
(b) For purposes of this subpart, special Government employees (as defined in \cf3 18 U.S.C.202\cf4 ) performing services as experts, advisors, or consultants, or as members of advisory committees, are not considered Government employees unless-\
(1) The contract arises directly out of the individual\'92s activity as a special Government employee;\
(2) In the individual\'92s capacity as a special Government employee, the individual is in a position to influence the award of the contract; or\
(3) Another conflict of interest is determined to exist.\

\f0\b 3.602 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 The agency head, or a designee not below the level of the head of the contracting activity, may authorize an exception to the policy in \cf3 3.601 \cf4 only if there is a most compelling reason to do so, such as when the Government\'92s needs cannot reasonably be otherwise met.\

\f0\b 3.603 Responsibilities of the contracting officer.\

\f1\b0 (a) Before awarding a contract, the contracting officer shall obtain an authorization under \cf3 3.602 \cf4 if-\
(1) The contracting officer knows, or has reason to believe, that a prospective contractor is one to which award is\
otherwise prohibited under \cf3 3.601\cf4 ; and\
(2) There is a most compelling reason to make an award to that prospective contractor.\
(b) The contracting officer shall comply with the requirements and guidance in \cf3 subpart 9.5 \cf4 before awarding a contract to an organization owned or substantially owned or controlled by Government employees.\

\fs24 Subpart 3.7 - Voiding and Rescinding Contracts\

\fs20 3.700 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart prescribes Governmentwide policies and procedures for exercising discretionary authority to declare void and rescind contracts in relation to which-\
(1) There has been a final conviction for bribery, conflict of interest, disclosure or receipt of contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information in exchange for a thing of value or to give anyone a competitive advantage in the award of a Federal agency procurement contract, or similar misconduct; or\
(2) There has been an agency head determination that contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information has been disclosed or received in exchange for a thing of value, or for the purpose of obtaining or giving anyone a competitive advantage in the award of a Federal agency procurement contract.\
(b) This subpart does not prescribe policies or procedures for, or govern the exercise of, any other remedy available to the Government with respect to such contracts, including but not limited to, the common law right of avoidance, rescission, or cancellation.\

\f0\b 3.701 Purpose.\

\f1\b0 This subpart provides-\
(a) An administrative remedy with respect to contracts in relation to which there has been-\
(1) A final conviction for bribery, conflict of interest, disclosure or receipt of contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information in exchange for a thing of value or to give anyone a competitive advantage in the award of a Federal agency procurement contract, or similar misconduct; or\
(2) An agency head determination that contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information has been disclosed or received in exchange for a thing of value, or for the purpose of obtaining or giving anyone a competitive advantage in the award of a Federal agency procurement contract; and\
(b) A means to deter similar misconduct in the future by those who are involved in the award, performance, and administration of Government contracts.\

\f0\b 3.702 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Final conviction 
\f1\i0 means a conviction, whether entered on a verdict or plea, including a plea of nolo contendere, for which a sentence has been imposed.\

\f0\b 3.703 Authority.\

\f1\b0 (a) Section 1(e) of Public Law 87-849, \cf3 18 U.S.C.218 \cf4 ("the Act"), empowers the President or the heads of executive agencies acting under regulations prescribed by the President, to declare void and rescind contracts and other transactions enumerated in the Act, in relation to which there has been a final conviction for bribery, conflict of interest, or any other violation of Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code (\cf3 18 U.S.C.201-224\cf4 ). Executive Order 12448, November 4,1983, delegates the President\'92s authority under the Act to the heads of the executive agencies and military departments.\
(b) \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2105(c) \cf4 requires a Federal agency, upon receiving information that a contractor or a person has violated \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2102\cf4 , to consider rescission of a contract with respect to which-\
(1) The contractor or someone acting for the contractor has been convicted for an offense punishable under \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2105(a)\cf4 ; or\
(2) The head of the agency, or designee, has determined, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the contractor or someone acting for the contractor has engaged in conduct constituting such an offense.\

\f0\b 3.704 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) In cases in which there is a final conviction for any violation of \cf3 18 U.S.C.201-224 \cf4 involving or relating to contracts awarded by an agency, the agency head or designee, shall consider the facts available and, if appropriate, may declare void and rescind contracts, and recover the amounts expended and property transferred by the agency in accordance with the policies and procedures of this subpart.\
(b) Since a final conviction under \cf3 18 U.S.C.201-224 \cf4 relating to a contract also may justify the conclusion that the party involved is not presently responsible, the agency should consider initiating debarment proceedings in accordance with \cf3 subpart\
9.4\cf4 , Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility, if debarment has not been initiated, or is not in effect at the time the final conviction is entered.\

(1) Declaring void and rescinding contracts, as appropriate, and recovering the amounts expended under the contracts by using the procedures at \cf3 3.705 \cf4 (see \cf3 3.104-7\cf4 ); and\

\f2\i Reporting
\f1\i0 . The facts concerning any final conviction for any violation of \cf3 18 U.S.C.201-224 \cf4 involving or relating to agency contracts shall be reported promptly to the agency head or designee for that official\'92s consideration. The agency head or designee shall promptly notify the Civil Division, Department of Justice, that the action is being considered under this subpart.\
(b) 
\f2\i Decision
\f1\i0 . Following an assessment of the facts, the agency head or designee may declare void and rescind contracts with respect to which a final conviction has been entered, and recover the amounts expended and the property transferred by the agency under the terms of the contracts involved.\
(c) 
\f2\i Decision-making process
\f1\i0 . Agency procedures governing the voiding and rescinding decision-making process shall be as informal as practicable, consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness. As a minimum, however, agencies shall provide the following:\
(1) A notice of proposed action to declare void and rescind the contract shall be made in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.\
(2) A thirty calendar day period after receipt of the notice, for the contractor to submit pertinent information before any final decision is made.\
(3) Upon request made within the period for submission of pertinent information, an opportunity shall be afforded for a hearing at which witnesses may be presented, and any witness the agency presents may be confronted. However, no inquiry shall be made regarding the validity of a conviction.\
(4) If the agency head or designee decides to declare void and rescind the contracts involved, that official shall issue a written decision which-\
(i) States that determination;\
(ii) Reflects consideration of the fair value of any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency; and (iii) States the amount due and the property to be returned to the agency.\
(d) 
\f2\i Notice of proposed action
\f1\i0 . The notice of proposed action, as a minimum shall-\
(1) Advise that consideration is being given to declaring void and rescinding contracts awarded by the agency, and\
recovering the amounts expended and property transferred therefor, under the provisions of \cf3 18 U.S.C.218\cf4 ;\
(2) Specifically identify the contracts affected by the action;\
(3) Specifically identify the offense or final conviction on which the action is based;\
(4) State the amounts expended and property transferred under each of the contracts involved, and the money and the\
property demanded to be returned;\
(5) Identify any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency under the contract, and the value of those\
benefits, as calculated by the agency;\
(6) Advise that pertinent information may be submitted within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, and that, if\
requested within that time, a hearing shall be held at which witnesses may be presented and any witness the agency presents may be confronted; and\
(7) Advise that action shall be taken only after the agency head or designee issues a final written decision on the proposed action.\
(e) 
\f2\i Final agency decision
\f1\i0 . The final agency decision shall be based on the information available to the agency head or designee, including any pertinent information submitted or, if a hearing was held, presented at the hearing. If the agency decision declares void and rescinds the contract, the final decision shall specify the amounts due and property to be returned to the agency, and reflect consideration of the fair value of any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency. Notice of the decision shall be sent promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested. Rescission of contracts under the authority of the Act and demand for recovery of the amounts expended and property transferred therefor, is not a claim within the meaning of \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 71\cf4 , Contract Disputes, or \cf3 part 32\cf4 .

(2) To the extent a person can demonstrate that the person has sufficient monies, other than Federal appropriated funds, the Government shall assume that these other monies were spent for any influencing activities that would be unallowable if paid for with Federal appropriated funds.\
(b) \cf3 31 U.S.C.1352 \cf4 also requires offerors to furnish a declaration consisting of both a certification and a disclosure, with periodic updates of the disclosure after contract award. These requirements are contained in the provision at \cf3 52.203-11\cf4 , Certification and Disclosure Regarding Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, and the clause at \cf3 52.203-12\cf4 , Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions.\

\f0\b 3.803 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) The prohibition of paragraph \cf3 3.802\cf4 (a) does not apply under the following conditions:\
(1) 
\f2\i Agency and legislative liaison by own employees
\f1\i0 . (i) Payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer\
or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action. For purposes of this paragraph, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is permitted at any time.\
(ii) Participating with an agency in discussions that are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action, but that concern-\
(A) The qualities and characteristics (including individual demonstrations) of the person\'92s products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; or\
(B) The application or adaptation of the person\'92s products or services for an agency\'92s use.\
(iii) Providing prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action any information not specifically requested\
but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action.\
(iv) Participating in technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official\
submission.\
(v) Making capability presentations prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action when seeking an\
award from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Pub. L. 95-507, and subsequent amendments.\
(2) Professional and technical services. (i) Payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal action;\
(ii) Any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving\
a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action, or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal action. Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.\
(iii) As used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section "professional and technical services" are limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional or a technical person are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client\'92s proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another, are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of\

(b) Only those communications and services expressly authorized by paragraph (a) of this section are permitted.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Government is prohibited from using fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal year funds for a contract with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report waste, fraud, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. See section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and its successor provisions in subsequent appropriations acts (and as extended in continuing resolutions.)\
(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312 (Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement), Form 4414 (Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Agreement), or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.\

Any offeror that does not so represent is ineligible for award of a contract.\
(b) The contracting officer may rely on an offeror's representation unless the contracting officer has reason to question the representation.\

\f1\b0 When using funding subject to the prohibitions in \cf3 3.909-1\cf4 (a), the contracting officer shall-\
(a) (1) Include the provision at \cf3 52.203-18\cf4 , Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Require Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements-Representation, in all solicitations, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and\
(2) Do not insert the provision in solicitations for a personal services contract with an individual if the services are to be performed entirely by the individual, rather than by an employee of the contractor or a subcontractor.\
(b) (1) Include the clause at \cf3 52.203-19\cf4 , Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements, in all solicitations and resultant contracts, other than personal services contracts with individuals.\

(b) Prescribes policies and procedures for the establishment of contractor codes of business ethics and conduct, and\
display of agency Office of Inspector General (OIG) fraud hotline posters.\

\f0\b 3.1001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f0\b 3.1002 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Government contractors must conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity and honesty.\

(1) Are suitable to the size of the company and extent of its involvement in Government contracting;\
(2) Facilitate timely discovery and disclosure of improper conduct in connection with Government contracts; and (3) Ensure corrective measures are promptly instituted and carried out.\

\f0\b 3.1003 Requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Contractor requirements.

agency OIG fraud hotline poster(s).\
(2) When requested by the Department of Homeland Security, agencies shall ensure that contracts funded with disaster\
assistance funds require display of any fraud hotline poster applicable to the specific contract. As established by the agency OIG, such posters may be displayed in lieu of, or in addition to, the agency\'92s standard poster.\

\f2\i Supplementary procurement instrument identifier 
\f1\i0 means the non-unique identifier for a procurement action that is used in conjunction with the Government-unique identifier. For example, an agency may use as its PIID for an amended solicitation, the Government-unique identifier for a solicitation number (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , N0002309R0009) in conjunction with a non-unique amendment number (

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) Executive Order12829, January 6, 1993 (58 FR3479, January 8, 1993), entitled "National Industrial Security Program" (NISP), establishes a program to safeguard Federal Government classified information that is released to contractors, licensees, and grantees of the United States Government. Executive Order 12829 amends Executive Order 10865, February 20, 1960 (25 FR1583, February 25, 1960), entitled "Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry," as amended by Executive Order 10909, January 17, 1961 (26 FR508, January 20, 1961).\
(b) The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) incorporates the requirements of these Executive orders. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with all affected agencies and with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, is responsible for issuance and maintenance of this Manual. The following publications implement the program:\
(1) National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (32 CFR part 117).\
(2) DoD Manual 5220.22, Volume 2, National Industrial Security Program: Industrial Security Procedures for Government Activities.\

(1) Provided that the data submittal is unclassified, the DD Form 254 shall be completed electronically in the NISP Contract Classification System (NCCS), which is accessible at \cf3 https://www.dcsa.mil/is/nccs/ \cf4 . Nondefense agencies with an existing DD Form 254 information system may use that system.\
(2) (i) A contractor, or subcontractor (if applicable), requiring access to classified information under a contract shall be identified with a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code on the DD Form 254 (see subpart \cf3 4.18 \cf4 for information on obtaining and validating CAGE codes).\
(ii) Each location of contractor or subcontractor performance listed on the DD Form 254 is required to reflect a corresponding unique CAGE code for each listed location unless the work is being performed at a Government facility, in which case the agency location code shall be used. Each subcontractor location requiring access to classified information must be listed on the DD Form 254.\
(iii) Contractor and subcontractor performance locations listed on the DD Form 254 are not required to be separately registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) solely for the purposes of a DD Form 254 (see subpart \cf3 4.11 \cf4 for information on registering in SAM).\
(e) Part 27, Patents, Data, and Copyrights, contains policy and procedures for safeguarding classified information in patent applications and patents.\

\f0\b 4.403 Responsibilities of contracting officers.\

(2) Contracting officers in agencies not covered by the NISP shall follow agency procedures.\

\f0\b 4.404 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.204-2\cf4 , Security Requirements, in solicitations and contracts when the contract may require access to classified information, unless the conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section apply.\
(b) If a cost contract (see \cf3 16.302\cf4 ) for research and development with an educational institution is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.\
(c) If a construction or architect-engineer contract where employee identification is required for security reasons is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II.\
(d) If the contracting agency is not covered by the NISP and has prescribed a clause and alternates that are substantially the same as those at \cf3 52.204-2\cf4 , the contracting officer shall use the agency-prescribed clause as required by agency procedures.\

\fs20 4.500 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart provides policy and procedures for the establishment and use of electronic commerce in Federal acquisition as required by \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2301\cf4 .\

\f0\b 4.501 [Reserved]\
4.502 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Federal Government shall use electronic commerce whenever practicable or cost-effective. The use of terms commonly associated with paper transactions (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 "copy," "document," "page," "printed," "sealed envelope," and "stamped") shall not be interpreted to restrict the use of electronic commerce. Contracting officers may supplement electronic transactions by using other media to meet the requirements of any contract action governed by the FAR (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 transmit hard copy of drawings).\
(b) Agencies may exercise broad discretion in selecting the hardware and software that will be used in conducting electronic commerce. However, as required by \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2301\cf4 , the head of each agency, after consulting with the Administrator of OFPP, shall ensure that systems, technologies, procedures, and processes used by the agency to conduct electronic commerce-\
(1) Are implemented uniformly throughout the agency, to the maximum extent practicable;\
(2) Are implemented only after considering the full or partial use of existing infrastructures;\
(3) Facilitate access to Government acquisition opportunities by small business concerns, small disadvantaged business\
concerns, women-owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; (4) Include a single means of providing widespread public notice of acquisition opportunities through the\
Governmentwide point of entry and a means of responding to notices or solicitations electronically; and\
(5) Comply with nationally and internationally recognized standards that broaden interoperability and ease the\
electronic interchange of information, such as standards established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. (c) Before using electronic commerce, the agency head shall ensure that the agency systems are capable of ensuring\
authentication and confidentiality commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information.\
(d) Agencies may accept electronic signatures and records in connection with Government contracts.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 4.6 - Contract Reporting\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes uniform reporting requirements for the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).\

\f0\b 4.601 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart\'97\

\f2\i Contract action 
\f1\i0 means any oral or written action that results in the purchase, rent, or lease of supplies or equipment, services, or construction using appropriated dollars over the micro-purchase threshold, or modifications to these actions regardless of dollar value. Contract action does not include grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions, real property leases, requisitions from Federal stock, training authorizations, or other non-FAR based transactions.\

\f2\i Contract action report (CAR) 
\f1\i0 means contract action data required to be entered into the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).\

\f2\i Definitive contract 
\f1\i0 means any contract that must be reported to FPDS other than an indefinite delivery vehicle. This definition is only for FPDS, and is not intended to apply to \cf3 part 16\cf4 .\

\f2\i Entitlement program 
\f1\i0 means a Federal program that guarantees a certain level of benefits to persons or other entities who meet requirements set by law, such as Social Security, farm price supports, or unemployment benefits.\

\f2\i Generic entity identifier 
\f1\i0 means a number or other identifier assigned to a category of vendors and not specific to any individual or entity.\

\f2\i Indefinite delivery vehicle (IDV) 
\f1\i0 means an indefinite delivery contract or agreement that has one or more of the following clauses:\
(1) \cf3 52.216-18\cf4 , Ordering.\
(2) \cf3 52.216-19\cf4 , Order Limitations.\
(3) \cf3 52.216-20\cf4 , Definite Quantity.\
(4) \cf3 52.216-21\cf4 , Requirements.\
(5) \cf3 52.216-22\cf4 , Indefinite Quantity.\
(6) Any other clause allowing ordering.\

\f0\b 4.602 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The FPDS provides a comprehensive web-based tool for agencies to report contract actions. The resulting data provides-\
(1) A basis for recurring and special reports to the President, the Congress, the Government Accountability Office, Federal executive agencies, and the general public;\
(2) A means of measuring and assessing the effect of Federal contracting on the Nation's economy and the extent to which small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women- owned small business concerns, and AbilityOne nonprofit agencies operating under \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 85\cf4 , Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, are sharing in Federal contracts;\
(3) A means of measuring and assessing the effect of Federal contracting for promoting sustainable technologies, materials, \cf2 products, services, and high-performance sustainable buildings. This is accomplished by collecting and reporting agency data on sustainable acquisition, including types of products purchased, the purchase costs, and the exceptions used for other than sustainable acquisition; and\
(4) A means of measuring and assessing the effect of other policy and management initiatives (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , performance based acquisitions and competition).\
(b) FPDS does not provide reports for certain acquisition information used in the award of a contract action (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , subcontracting data, funding data, or accounting data).\
(c) The FPDS Web site, \cf3 https://www.fpds.gov\cf4 , provides instructions for submitting data. It also provides- (1) A complete list of departments, agencies, and other entities that submit data to the FPDS;\
(2) Technical and end-user guidance;\
(3) A computer-based tutorial; and\
(4) Information concerning reports not generated in FPDS.\

(b) Executive agencies shall use FPDS to maintain publicly available information about all unclassified contract actions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, and any modifications to those actions that change previously reported contract action report data, regardless of dollar value.\
(c) Agencies awarding assisted acquisitions or direct acquisitions must report these actions and identify the Program/ Funding Agency and Office Codes from the applicable agency codes maintained by each agency at FPDS. These codes represent the agency and office that has provided the predominant amount of funding for the contract action. For assisted acquisitions, the requesting agency will receive socioeconomic credit for meeting agency small business goals, where applicable. Requesting agencies shall provide the appropriate agency/bureau component code as part of the written interagency agreement between the requesting and servicing agencies (see \cf3 17.502-1\cf4 (a)(1)).\
(d) Agencies awarding contract actions with a mix of appropriated and non-appropriated funding shall only report the full appropriated portion of the contract action in FPDS.\

\f0\b 4.604 Responsibilities.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Senior Procurement Executive in coordination with the head of the contracting activity is responsible for developing and monitoring a process to ensure timely and accurate reporting of contractual actions to FPDS.\
(b) (1) The responsibility for the completion and accuracy of the individual contract action report (CAR) resides with the contracting officer who awarded the contract action. CARs in a draft or error status in FPDS are not considered complete.\
(2) The CAR must be confirmed for accuracy by the contracting officer prior to release of the contract award. The CAR must then be completed in FPDS within three business days after contract award.\
(3) For any action awarded in accordance with FAR \cf3 6.302-2 \cf4 or pursuant to any of the authorities listed at subpart \cf3 18.2\cf4 , the CAR must be completed in FPDS within 30 days after contract award.\
(4) When the contracting office receives written notification that a contractor has changed its size status in accordance with the clause at \cf3 52.219-28\cf4 , Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, the contracting officer shall update the size status in FPDS within 30 days after receipt of contractor\'92s notification of rerepresentation.\
(5) If after award of a contract, the contracting officer receives written notification of SBA\'92s final decision on a protest concerning a size determination, the contracting officer shall update FPDS to reflect the final decision.\
(c) The chief acquisition officer of each agency required to report its contract actions must submit to the General Services Administration (GSA), in accordance with FPDS guidance, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an annual certification of whether, and to what degree, agency CAR data for the preceding fiscal year is complete and accurate.\

\f0\b 4.605 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID)
\f1\i0 . Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID reported to FPDS is unique Governmentwide, for all solicitations, contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic agreements, basic ordering agreements, or orders in accordance with \cf3 4.1601 \cf4 to \cf3 4.1603\cf4 , and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of contract award. Other pertinent PIID instructions for FPDS reporting can be found at \cf3 https://www.fpds.gov\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Unique entity identifier
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall identify and report a unique entity identifier for the successful offeror on a contract action. The unique entity identifier shall correspond to the successful offeror's name and address as stated in the offer and resultant contract, and as registered in the System for Award Management in accordance with the provision at \cf3 52.204-7\cf4 , System for Award Management. The contracting officer shall ask the offeror to provide its unique entity identifier by using either the provision at \cf3 52.204-6\cf4 , Unique Entity Identifier, the provision at \cf3 52.204-7\cf4 , System for Award Management, or the provision at \cf3 52.212-1\cf4 , Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. (For a discussion of the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, which is a different identifier, see \cf3 subpart 4.18\cf4 .)\
(c) Generic entity identifier. (1) The use of a generic entity identifier should be limited, and only used in the situations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Use of a generic entity identifier does not supersede the requirements of provisions \cf3 52.204-6\cf4 , Unique Entity Identifier or \cf3 52.204-7 \cf4 System for Award Management (if present in the solicitation) for the contractor to have a unique entity identifier assigned.\
(2) Authorized generic entity identifiers, maintained by the Integrated Award Environment (IAE) program office (\cf3 http:// www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105036\cf4 ), may be used to report contracts in lieu of the contractor's actual unique entity identifier only for\'97\

\fs24 Subpart 4.7 - Contractor Records Retention\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart provides policies and procedures for retention of records by contractors to meet the records review requirements of the Government. In this subpart, the terms "contracts" and "contractors" include "subcontracts" and "subcontractors."\

\f0\b 4.701 Purpose.\

\f1\b0 The purpose of this subpart is to generally describe records retention requirements and to allow reductions in the retention period for specific classes of records under prescribed circumstances.\

\f0\b 4.702 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart applies to records generated under contracts that contain one of the following clauses: (1) Audit and Records-Sealed Bidding (\cf3 52.214-26\cf4 ).\
(2) Audit and Records-Negotiation (\cf3 52.215-2\cf4 ).\
(b) This subpart is not mandatory on Department of Energy contracts for which the Comptroller General allows alternative records retention periods. Apart from this exception, this subpart applies to record retention periods under contracts that are subject to 10 U.S.C. chapter 137 legacy provisions ( \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3064\cf4 ) and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3016 \cf4 and chapter 203, or \cf3 40 U.S.C. 101\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq
\f1\i0 .\

\f0\b 4.703 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as stated in \cf3 4.703\cf4 (b), contractors shall make available records, which includes books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and regardless of whether such items are in written form, in the form of computer data, or in any other form, and other supporting evidence to satisfy contract negotiation, administration, and audit requirements of the contracting agencies and the Comptroller General for-\
(1) 3 years after final payment; or\
(2) For certain records the period specified in \cf3 4.705 \cf4 through \cf3 4.705-3\cf4 , whichever of these periods expires first.\
(b) Contractors shall make available the foregoing records and supporting evidence for a longer period of time than is\
required in \cf3 4.703\cf4 (a) if-\
(1) A retention period longer than that cited in \cf3 4.703\cf4 (a) is specified in any contract clause; or\
(2) The contractor, for its own purposes, retains the foregoing records and supporting evidence for a longer period.\
Under this circumstance, the retention period shall be the period of the contractor\'92s retention or 3 years after final payment, whichever period expires first.\
(3) The contractor does not meet the original due date for submission of final indirect cost rate proposals specified in paragraph (d)(2) of the clause at \cf3 52.216-7\cf4 , Allowable Cost and Payment. Under these circumstances, the retention periods in \cf3 4.705 \cf4 shall be automatically extended one day for each day the proposal is not submitted after the original due date.\
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a contractor from duplicating or storing original records in electronic form unless they contain significant information not shown on the record copy. Original records need not be maintained or produced in an audit if the contractor or subcontractor provides photographic or electronic images of the original records and meets the following requirements:\
(1) The contractor or subcontractor has established procedures to ensure that the imaging process preserves accurate images of the original records, including signatures and other written or graphic images, and that the imaging process is reliable and secure so as to maintain the integrity of the records.\
(2) The contractor or subcontractor maintains an effective indexing system to permit timely and convenient access to the imaged records.\
(3) The contractor or subcontractor retains the original records for a minimum of one year after imaging to permit periodic validation of the imaging systems.\
(d) If the information described in paragraph (a) of this section is maintained on a computer, contractors shall retain the computer data on a reliable medium for the time periods prescribed. Contractors may transfer computer data in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. Contractors\'92 computer data retention and transfer procedures shall maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original computer data. Contractors shall also retain an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed, contractors shall not destroy, discard, delete, or write over such computer data.\

\f0\b\fs20 4.704 Calculation of retention periods.\

\f1\b0 (a) The retention periods in \cf3 4.705 \cf4 are calculated from the end of the contractor\'92s fiscal year in which an entry is made charging or allocating a cost to a Government contract or subcontract. If a specific record contains a series of entries, the retention period is calculated from the end of the contractor\'92s fiscal year in which the final entry is made. The contractor should cut off the records in annual blocks and retain them for block disposal under the prescribed retention periods.\
(b) When records generated during a prior contract are relied upon by a contractor for certified cost or pricing data in negotiating a succeeding contract, the prescribed periods shall run from the date of the succeeding contract.\
(c) If two or more of the record categories described in \cf3 4.705 \cf4 are interfiled and screening for disposal is not practical, the contractor shall retain the entire record series for the longest period prescribed for any category of records.\

\f0\b 4.705 Specific retention periods.\

\f1\b0 The contractor shall retain the records identified in \cf3 4.705-1 \cf4 through \cf3 4.705-3 \cf4 for the periods designated, provided retention is required under \cf3 4.702\cf4 . Records are identified in this subpart in terms of their purpose or use and not by specific name or form number. Although the descriptive identifications may not conform to normal contractor usage or filing practices, these identifications apply to all contractor records that come within the description.\

\f0\b 4.805 Storage, handling, and contract files.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies must prescribe procedures for the handling, storing, and disposing of contract files, in accordance with\
the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedule \cf3 1.1\cf4 , Financial Management and Reporting Records. The Financial Management and Reporting Records can be found at \cf3 http://www.archives.gov/records- mgmt/grs.html\cf4 . These procedures must take into account documents held in all types of media, including microfilm and various electronic media. Agencies may change the original medium to facilitate storage as long as the requirements of\
the part, law, and other regulations are satisfied. The process used to create and store records must record and reproduce\
the original document, including signatures and other written and graphic images completely, accurately, and clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures must protect the original data from alteration. Unless law or other regulations require signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed after the responsible agency official verifies that record copies on alternate media and copies reproduced from the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear representations of the originals. When original documents have been converted to alternate media for storage, the requirements in Table 4-1 of this section also apply to the record copies in the alternate media.\
(b) If administrative records are mixed with program records and cannot be economically segregated, the entire file should be kept for the period of time approved for the program records. Similarly, if documents described in the following table are part of a subject or case file that documents activities that are not described in the table, they should be treated in the same manner as the files of which they are a part.\
(c) An agency that requires a shorter retention period than those identified in Table 4-1 shall request approval from NARA through the agency\'92s records officer.\

\fs24 Subpart 4.9 - Taxpayer Identification Number Information\

\fs20 4.900 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart provides policies and procedures for obtaining-\
(a) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) information that may be used for debt collection purposes; and\
(b) Contract information and payment information for submittal to the payment office for Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\
reporting purposes.\

\f0\b 4.901 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Common parent
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means that corporate entity that owns or controls an affiliated group of corporations that files its Federal income tax returns on a consolidated basis, and of which the offeror is a member.\

\f0\b 4.902 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Debt collection
\f1\i0 . \cf3 31 U.S.C.7701(c) \cf4 requires each contractor doing business with a Government agency to furnish its TIN to that agency. \cf3 31 U.S.C.3325(d) \cf4 requires the Government to include, with each certified voucher prepared by the Government payment office and submitted to a disbursing official, the TIN of the contractor receiving payment under the voucher. The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the contractor\'92s relationship with the Government.\
(b) 
\f2\i Information reporting to the IRS
\f1\i0 . The TIN is also required for Government reporting of certain contract information (see \cf3 4.903\cf4 ) and payment information (see \cf3 4.904\cf4 ) to the IRS.\

\f0\b 4.903 Reporting contract information to the IRS.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 26 U.S.C.6050M\cf4 , as implemented in 26 CFR, requires heads of Federal executive agencies to report certain information to the IRS.\
(b) (1) The required information applies to contract modifications-\
(i) Increasing the amount of a contract awarded before January 1,1989, by $50,000 or more; and (ii) Entered into on or after April 1,1990.\

\fs24 Subpart 4.10 - Uniform Use of Line Items\

\fs20 4.1000 Scope.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning line items and subline items and their identifiers. However, in order to provide agencies with time to transition their information systems, agencies have until October 1, 2019, to apply the requirements of \cf3 4.1002 \cf4 through \cf3 4.1008\cf4 .\

\f0\b 4.1001 Policy.\

\f1\b0 In order to improve the accuracy, traceability, and usability of procurement data, procurement instruments shall identify the supplies or services to be acquired as separately identified line items and, as needed, subline items.\
(a) Line items are established to define deliverables or organize information about deliverables. Each line item describes characteristics for the item purchased, 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , pricing, delivery, and funding information.\
(b) Each line item may be subdivided into separate unique subsets (called subline items) to ease administration. If a line item has deliverable subline items, the line item is informational. Subline items differentiate between or among certain characteristics of the line item, such as colors or sizes, dates of delivery, destinations, or places of performance. Subline items are established to define deliverables or organize information about deliverables.\

\f0\b 4.1002 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 The policies of this subpart shall apply to the following procurement instruments, to include amendments, modifications, and change orders thereto:\
(a) Solicitations.\
(b) Contracts, including, but not limited to, Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), multi-agency contracts (MACs), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts, indefinite-delivery contracts, and purchase orders.\
(c) Agreements that include pre-priced supplies or services. (d) Task and delivery orders.\

\f0\b 4.1003 Establishing line items.\

\f1\b0 Establish separate line items for deliverables that have the following characteristics except as provided at \cf3 4.1005-2\cf4 : (a) Separately identifiable.\
(1) A supply is separately identifiable if it has its own identification (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , national stock number (NSN), item description, manufacturer's part number).\
(2) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one statement of work or performance work statement.\
(3) If the procurement instrument involves a first article (see \cf3 subpart 9.3\cf4 ), establish a separate line item for each item requiring a separate approval. If the first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of items that will be approved as a single lot, a single line item may be used.\
(b) Single unit price or total price.\
(c) Single accounting classification citation. A single deliverable may be funded by multiple accounting classifications when the deliverable effort cannot be otherwise subdivided.\
(d) Separate delivery schedule, destination, period of performance, or place of performance. (e) Single contract pricing type (e.g., fixed-price or cost-reimbursement).\

\f0\b 4.1004 Establishing subline items.\

\f1\b0 Subline items may be used to facilitate tracking of performance, deliverables, payment, and contract funds accounting or for other management purposes. Subline items may be either deliverable or informational. The list of characteristics at \cf3 4.1003 \cf4 applies to deliverable subline items, but it is not applicable to informational subline items. A line item with subline items shall contain only that information that is common to all subline items thereunder. All subline items under one line item shall be the same contract type as the line item.\
(a) 
\f2\i Deliverable subline items
\f1\i0 . Deliverable subline items may be used for several related items that require separate identification. For example, instead of establishing multiple separate line items, subline items may be established for-\
(1) Items that are basically the same, except for minor variations such as\'96 (i) Size or color;\
(ii) Accounting classification, but see also \cf3 4.1005-1\cf4 (a)(4); or\
    4.10-1\

\fs20 (iii) Date of delivery, destination, or period or place of performance;\
(2) Separately priced collateral functions that relate to the primary product, such as packaging and handling, or\
transportation; or\
(3) Items to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance.\
(b) 
\f2\i Informational subline items
\f1\i0 .\
(1) Informational subline items may be used by agencies for administrative purposes. This type of subline item\
identifies information that relates directly to the line item and is an integral part of it (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , parts of an assembly or parts of a kit).\
(2) Position informational subline items within the line item description, not in the quantity or price fields.\

\f0\b 4.1005 Data elements for line items and subline items.\
4.1005-1 Required data elements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in \cf3 4.1005-2\cf4 , each line item or subline item shall include in the schedule (described at \cf3 12.303\cf4 (b)(4), \cf3 14.201-2\cf4 , or \cf3 15.204-2\cf4 , or in a comparable section of the procurement instrument), at a minimum, the following information as separate, distinct data elements:\
(1) Line item or subline item number established in accordance with agency procedures. (2) Description of what is being purchased.\
(3) Product or Service Code (PSC).\
(4) Accounting classification citation.\
(i) Line items or deliverable subline items. If multiple accounting classifications for a single deliverable apply, include the dollar amount for each accounting classification in the schedule (or a comparable section of the procurement instrument).\
(ii) Informational subline items. An accounting classification citation is not required. (See \cf3 4.1004\cf4 ). (5) (i) For fixed-price line items:\
(A) Unit of measure. (B) Quantity.\
(C) Unit price.\
(D) Total price.\
(ii) For cost-reimbursement line items: (A) Unit of measure.\
(B) Quantity.\
(C) Estimated cost.\
(D) Fee (if any).\
(E) Total estimated cost plus any fee.\
(b) If a contract contains a combination of fixed-price, time-and-materials, labor-hour, or cost-reimbursable line items,\
identify the contract type for each line item in the schedule (or a comparable section of the procurement instrument) to facilitate payment.\
(c) Each deliverable line item or deliverable subline item shall have its own delivery schedule, destination, period\
of performance, or place of performance expressly stated in the appropriate section of the procurement instrument ("as required" constitutes an expressly stated delivery term). When a line item has deliverable subline items, the delivery schedule, destination, period of performance, or place of performance shall be identified at the subline item level, rather than the line item level.\
(d) Terms and conditions in other sections of the contract (such as contract clauses or payment instructions) shall also specify applicability to individual line items if not applicable to the contract as a whole.\

\f0\b 4.1005-2 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Indefinite-delivery contracts
\f1\i0 -\
(1) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . The following required data elements are not known at time of issuance of an indefinite-delivery contract,\

\f1\b0 (2) 
\f2\i Indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) and requirements contracts
\f1\i0 . (i) IDIQ and requirements contracts may omit the quantity at the line item level for the base award provided that the total contract minimum and maximum, or the estimate, respectively, is stated.\
(ii) Multiple-award IDIQ contracts awarded using the procedures at \cf3 13.106-1\cf4 (a)(2)(iv)(A) or \cf3 15.304\cf4 (c)(1)(ii)(A) may omit price or cost at the line item or subline item level for the contract award, provided that the total contract minimum and maximum is stated (see \cf3 16.504\cf4 (a)(1)).\
(b) 
\f2\i Item description and PSC
\f1\i0 . These data elements are not required in the line item if there are associated deliverable subline items that include the actual detailed identification. When this exception applies, use a general narrative description for the line item.\
(c) 
\f2\i Single unit price or single total price
\f1\i0 . The requirement for a single unit price or single total price at the line item level does not apply if any of the following conditions are present:\
(1) There are associated deliverable subline items that are priced.\

the actual number of the elements is not known until performance (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , a labor-hour contract for maintenance/repair). The contracting officer may structure these procurement instruments to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item.\

\f0\b 4.1006 Modifications.\

\f1\b0 (a) When a new item (such as an increased quantity) is added to the procurement instrument, assign a new line item number.\
(b) If the modification relates to existing line items, the modification shall refer to those items.\

\f0\b 4.1007 Solicitation alternative line item proposal.\

\f1\b0 Solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to propose alternative line items (see \cf3 4.1008 \cf4 and \cf3 52.212-1\cf4 (e)). For example, when soliciting certain items using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot, the offeror may not be able to group and deliver all items in a single shipment.\

\f0\b 4.1008 Solicitation provision.\

\f1\b0 Insert the provision at \cf3 52.204-22\cf4 , Alternative Line Item Proposal, in all solicitations.\

\fs24 Subpart 4.14 - Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards\

\fs20 4.1400 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart implements section 2 of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub.L.109-282), as amended by section 6202 of the Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-252), which requires contractors to report subcontract award data and the total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the contractor and subcontractor. The public may view first-tier subcontract award data at \cf3 http://www.usaspending.gov\cf4 .\

\f0\b 4.1401 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart applies to all contracts with a value of $30,000 or more. Nothing in this subpart requires the disclosure of classified information.\
(b) Reporting of subcontract information will be limited to the first-tier subcontractor.\

\f0\b 4.1402 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall ensure that contractors comply with the reporting requirements of \cf3 52.204-10\cf4 , Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards. Agencies shall review contractor reports on a quarterly basis to ensure the information is consistent with contract information. The agency is not required to address data for which the agency would not normally have supporting information, such as the compensation information required of contractors and first- tier subcontractors. However, the agency shall inform the contractor of any inconsistencies with the contract information and require that the contractor correct the report, or provide a reasonable explanation as to why it believes the information is correct. Agencies may review the reports at \cf3 http://www.fsrs.gov\cf4 .\
(b) When contracting officers report the contract action to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) in accordance with FAR \cf3 subpart 4.6\cf4 , certain data will then pre-populate from FPDS, to assist contractors in completing and submitting their reports. If data originating from FPDS is found by the contractor to be in error when the contractor completes the subcontract report, the contractor should notify the Government contracting officer, who is responsible for correcting the data in FPDS. Contracts reported using the generic entity identifier allowed at FAR \cf3 4.605\cf4 (c)(2) will interfere with the contractor\'92s ability to comply with this reporting requirement, because the data will not pre-populate from FPDS.\
(c) If the contractor fails to comply with the reporting requirements, the contracting officer shall exercise appropriate contractual remedies. In addition, the contracting officer shall make the contractor\'92s failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the contractor\'92s performance information under \cf3 subpart 42.15\cf4 .\
(d) There is a reporting exception in \cf3 52.204-10\cf4 (g) for contractors and subcontractors who had gross income in the previous tax year under $300,000.\

\f0\b 4.1403 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.204-10\cf4 , Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards, in all solicitations and contracts of $30,000 or more. (b) The clause is not prescribed for contracts that are not required to be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System\
(FPDS) (see \cf3 subpart 4.6\cf4 ).\

\fs24 Subpart 4.16 - Unique Procurement Instrument Identifiers\

\fs20 4.1600 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning unique Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) for each solicitation, contract, agreement, or order and related procurement instrument.\

\f0\b 4.1601 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Establishment of a Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID used to identify a solicitation or contract action is unique Governmentwide, and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of contract award. The PIID shall be used to identify all solicitation and contract actions. The PIID shall also be used to identify solicitation and contract actions in designated support and reporting systems (e.g., Federal Procurement Data System, System for Award Management), in accordance with regulations, applicable authorities, and agency policies and procedures.)\
(b) Transition of PIID numbering. No later than October 1, 2017, agencies shall comply with paragraph (a) of this section and use the requirements in \cf3 4.1602 \cf4 and \cf3 4.1603 \cf4 for all new solicitations and contract awards. Until an agency\'92s transition\
is complete, it shall maintain its 2013 PIID format that is on record with the General Services Administration\'92s Integrated Award Environment Program Office (which maintains a registry of the agency unique identifier scheme). The 2013 PIID format consisted of alpha characters in the first positions to indicate the agency, followed by alpha-numeric characters; the 2017 format instead has the AAC in the beginning 6 positions.\
(c) Change in the Procurement Instrument Identifier after its assignment. (1) Agencies shall not change the PIID unless one of the following two circumstances apply:\
(i) The PIID serial numbering system is exhausted. In this instance, the contracting officer may assign a new PIID by issuing a contract modification.\
(ii) Continued use of a PIID is administratively burdensome (e.g., for implementations of new agency contract writing systems). In this instance, the contracting officer may assign a new PIID by issuing a contract modification.\
(2) The modification shall clearly identify both the original and the newly assigned PIID. Issuance of a new PIID is an administrative change (see \cf3 43.101\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 4.1602 Identifying the PIID and supplementary PIID.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Identifying the PIID in solicitation and contract award documentation (including forms and electronic generated formats). 
\f1\i0 Agencies shall include all PIIDs for all related procurement actions as identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.\
(1) 
\f2\i Solicitation
\f1\i0 . Identify the PIID for all solicitations. For amendments to solicitations, identify a supplementary PIID, in conjunction with the PIID for the solicitation.\
(2) 
\f2\i Contracts and purchase orders
\f1\i0 . Identify the PIID for contracts and purchase orders.\
(3) 
\f2\i Delivery and task orders. 
\f1\i0 For delivery and task orders placed by an agency under a contract (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, multi-agency contracts (MAC), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), or Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contracts), identify the PIID for the delivery and task order and the PIID for the contract.\
(4) 
\f2\i Blanket purchase agreements and basic ordering agreements. 
\f1\i0 Identify the PIID for blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with \cf3 13.303\cf4 , and for basic agreements and basic ordering agreements issued in accordance with subpart \cf3 16.7\cf4 . For blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with subpart \cf3 8.4 \cf4 under a MAS contract, identify the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement and the PIID for the MAS contract.\
(i) 
\f2\i Orders
\f1\i0 . For orders against basic ordering agreements or blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with \cf3 13.303\cf4 , identify the PIID for the order and the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement or basic ordering agreement.\
(ii) 
\f2\i Orders under subpart \cf3 8.4\cf4 . 
\f1\i0 For orders against a blanket purchase agreement established under a MAS contract, identify the PIID for the order, the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement, and the PIID for the MAS contract.\
(5) 
\f2\i Modifications. 
\f1\i0 For modifications to actions described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section, and in accordance with agency procedures, identify a supplementary PIID for the modification in conjunction with the PIID for the contract, order, or agreement being modified.\
(b) 
\f2\i Placement of the PIID on forms. 
\f1\i0 When the form (including electronic generated format) does not provide spaces or fields for the PIID or supplementary PIID required in paragraph (a) of this section, identify the PIID in accordance with agency procedures.\

\fs20 (c) Additional agency specific identification information. If agency procedures require additional identification information in solicitations, contracts, or other related procurement instruments for administrative purposes, separate and clearly identify the additional information from the PIID.\

\f0\b 4.1603 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Elements of a PIID
\f1\i0 . The PIID consists of a combination of thirteen to seventeen alpha and/or numeric characters sequenced to convey certain information. Do not use special characters (such as hyphens, dashes, or spaces).\
(1) 
\f2\i Positions 1 through 6
\f1\i0 . The first six positions identify the department/agency and office issuing the instrument. Use the AAC assigned to the issuing office for positions 1 through 6. Civilian agency points of contact for obtaining an AAC are on the AAC Contact list maintained by the General Services Administration and can be found at \cf3 https://community.max.gov/ x/24foL\cf4 . For Department of Defense (DoD) inquiries, contact the service/agency Central Service Point or DoD AAC Monitor, or if unknown, email \cf3 DODAADHQ@DLA.MIL \cf4 for assistance.\
(2) 
\f2\i Positions 7 through 8
\f1\i0 . The seventh and eighth positions are the last two digits of the fiscal year in which the procurement instrument is issued or awarded. This is the date the action is signed, not the effective date if the effective date is different.\
(3) 
\f2\i Position 9
\f1\i0 . Indicate the type of instrument by entering one of the following upper case letters in position nine. Departments and independent agencies may assign those letters identified for department use below in accordance with their agency policy; however, any use must be applied to the entire department or agency.\

(4) Positions 10 through 17. Enter the number assigned by the issuing agency in these positions. Agencies may choose a minimum of four characters up to a maximum of eight characters to be used, but the same number of characters must be used agency-wide. If a number less than the maximum is used, do not use leading or trailing zeroes to make it equal the maximum in any system or data transmission. A separate series of numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An agency may reserve blocks of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various components.\
(5) Illustration of PIID. The following illustrates a properly configured PIID using four characters in the final positions:\
(b) 
\f2\i Elements of a supplementary PIID
\f1\i0 . Use the supplementary PIID to identify amendments to solicitations and modifications to contracts, orders, and agreements. The supplementary PIID is reported as a separate data element used in conjunction with, but not appended to, the PIID.\
(1) Amendments to solicitations. Number amendments to solicitations sequentially using a four position numeric serial number added to the 13-17 character PIID beginning with 0001.\
(2) Modifications to contracts, orders, and agreements. Number modifications to contracts, orders, and agreements using a six position alpha or numeric, or a combination thereof, added to the 13-17 character PIID. For example, a\

\f1\b0 This subpart implements section 743(a) of Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-117), which requires agencies to report annually to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on activities performed by service contractors. Section 743(a) applies to executive agencies, other than the Department of Defense (DoD), covered by the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act (Pub. L. 105-270) (FAIR Act). The information reported in the inventory will be publicly accessible.\

\f0\b 4.1701 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart\'96\

\f2\i FAIR Act agencies 
\f1\i0 means the agencies required under the FAIR Act to submit inventories annually of the activities performed by Government personnel.\

\f2\i First-tier subcontract 
\f1\i0 means a subcontract awarded directly by the contractor for the purpose of acquiring supplies or services (including construction) for performance of a prime contract. It does not include the contractor\'92s supplier agreements with vendors, such as long-term arrangements for materials or supplies that benefit multiple contracts and/or the costs of which are normally applied to a contractor\'92s general and administrative expenses or indirect costs.\

\f0\b 4.1702 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart applies to\'96\
(1) All FAIR Act agencies, except DoD as specified in \cf3 4.1705\cf4 ;\
(2) Solicitations, contracts, and orders for services (including construction) that meet or exceed the thresholds at\
\cf3 4.1703\cf4 ; and\
(3) Contractors and first-tier subcontractors.\
(b) Procedures for compiling and submitting agency service contract inventories are governed by section 743(a)(3) of Division C of Pub. L. 111-117 and Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) guidance. The guidance is available at the following Web site: \cf3 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/service_ contract_inventories.pdf\cf2 .\
(c) This subpart addresses requirements for obtaining information from, and reporting by, agency service contractors.\

\f0\b 4.1703 Reporting requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Thresholds. (1) Except as exempted by OFPP guidance, service contractor reporting shall be required for contracts\
and first-tier subcontracts for services based on type of contract and estimated total value. For indefinite-delivery contracts, reporting shall be determined based on the type and estimated total value of each order under the contract. Indefinite-delivery contracts include, but are not limited to, contracts such as indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, Federal Supply Schedule contracts (FSSs), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and multi-agency contracts.\
(2) Reporting is required according to the following thresholds:\
(i) All cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, and labor-hour service contracts and orders with an estimated total\
value above the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(ii) All fixed-price service contracts awarded and orders issued according to the following thresholds:\
(A) Awarded or issued in Fiscal Year 2014, with an estimated total value of $2.5 million or greater.\
(B) Awarded or issued in Fiscal Year 2015, with an estimated total value of $1 million or greater.\
(C) Awarded or issued in Fiscal Year 2016, and subsequent years, with an estimated total value of $500,000 or\
greater.\
(3) Reporting is required for all first-tier subcontracts for services as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this\
section.\
(b) Agency reporting responsibilities. (1) Agencies shall ensure that contractors comply with the reporting requirements\
of \cf3 52.204-14\cf4 , Service Contract Reporting Requirements and \cf3 52.204-15\cf4 , Service Contract Reporting Requirements for Indefinite-Delivery Contracts. Agencies shall review contractor reported information for reasonableness and consistency with available contract information. The agency is not required to address data for which the agency would not normally have supporting information. In the event the agency believes that revisions to the contractor reported information are warranted, the agency shall notify the contractor no later than November 15. By November 30, the contractor shall revise the report, or document its rationale for the agency. Authorized agency officials may review the reports at \cf3 www.sam.gov\cf4 .\

\fs20 (2) Agencies are required to compile annually an inventory of service contracts performed for, or on behalf of, the agency during the prior fiscal year in order to determine the extent of the agency\'92s reliance on service contractors. Agencies shall submit a service contract inventory to OMB by January 15 annually. Then, each agency must post the inventory on its Web site and publish a Federal Register Notice of Availability by February 15 annually.\
(3) Most of the required information is already collected in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). Information not collected in FPDS will be provided by the contractor, as specified in \cf3 52.204-14\cf4 , Service Contract Reporting Requirements and \cf3 52.204-15\cf4 , Service Contract Reporting Requirements for Indefinite-Delivery Contracts.\

\f0\b 4.1704 Contracting officer responsibilities.\

\f1\b0 (a) For other than indefinite-delivery contracts, the contracting officer shall ensure that \cf3 52.204-14\cf4 , Service Reporting Requirement, is included in solicitations, contracts, and orders as prescribed at \cf3 4.1705\cf4 . For indefinite-delivery contracts,\
the contracting officer who awarded the contract shall ensure that \cf3 52.204-15 \cf4 Service Contract Reporting Requirements for Indefinite-Delivery Contracts, is included in solicitations and contracts as prescribed at \cf3 4.1705\cf4 . The contracting officer at the order level shall verify the clause\'92s inclusion in the contract.\
(b) If the contractor fails to submit a report in a timely manner, the contracting officer shall exercise appropriate contractual remedies. In addition, the contracting officer shall make the contractor\'92s failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the contractor\'92s performance information under \cf3 subpart 42.15\cf4 .\

\f0\b 4.1705 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.204-14\cf4 , Service Contract Reporting Requirements, in solicitations and contracts for services (including construction) that meet or exceed the thresholds at \cf3 4.1703\cf4 , except for indefinite-delivery contracts. This clause is not required for actions entirely funded by DoD, contracts awarded with a generic entity identifier, or in classified solicitations, contracts, or orders.\
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.204-15\cf4 , Service Contract Reporting Requirements for Indefinite- Delivery Contracts, in solicitations and indefinite-delivery contracts for services (including construction) where one or more orders issued thereunder are expected to each meet or exceed the thresholds at \cf3 4.1703\cf4 .

(2) Some FASCSA orders will not be identified in SAM and will need to be identified in the solicitation to be effective for that acquisition. The requiring activity or program office will identify these FASCSA orders to the contracting officer (see \cf3 4.2304\cf4 (d)).\
(3) The contracting officer shall work with the program office or requiring activity to identify which FASCSA orders apply to the acquisition.\

\f0\b 4.2304 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Identifying applicable FASCSA orders. 
\f1\i0 The applicability of FASCSA orders to a particular acquisition depends on the contracting office's agency, the scope of the FASCSA order, the funding, and whether the requirement involves certain types of information systems (see the definition of FASCSA order at \cf3 4.2301\cf4 ). The contracting officer shall coordinate with the program office or requiring activity to identify the FASCSA order(s) that apply to the acquisition as follows:\
(1) Unless the program office or requiring activity instructs the contracting officer otherwise, FASCSA orders apply\
as follows: contracts awarded by civilian agencies will be subject to DHS FASCSA orders, and contracts awarded by the Department of Defense will be subject to DoD FASCSA orders. See paragraph (b) of \cf3 52.204-30\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders-Prohibition.\
(2) For acquisitions where the program office or the requiring activity instructs the contracting officer to select specific FASCSA orders, the contracting officer must select \'93yes\'94 or \'93no\'94 for each applicable type of FASCSA order ( 
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , \'93DHS FASCSA Order\'94 \'93DoD FASCSA Order\'94 or \'93DNI FASCSA Order\'94). See paragraph (b)(1) of \cf3 52.204-30\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders\'97Prohibition, with its Alternate I.\
(b) Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, multi-agency contracts specific procedures\'97 (1) Applying FASCSA orders. An agency awarding this type of contract may choose to apply FASCSA orders in accordance with agency policy as follows:\
(i) 
\f2\i Application at the contract level. 
\f1\i0 The agency awarding the basic contract may choose to apply FASCSA orders\
to the basic contract award. This is the preferred method, especially if small value orders or orders without a request for quotation (RFQ) are expected. Ordering activity contracting officers may use this contract vehicle without taking further steps to identify applicable FASCSA orders in the order. The contracting officer awarding the basic contract would select \'93yes\'94 for all FASCSA orders ( 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 \'93DHS FASCSA Order\'94 \'93DoD FASCSA Order\'94 and \'93DNI FASCSA Order\'94) (see paragraph (b)(1) of \cf3 52.204-30\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders\'97Prohibition, with its Alternate I). If the contracting officer becomes aware of a newly issued applicable FASCSA order, then the agency awarding the basic contract shall modify the basic contract to remove any covered article, or any products or services produced or provided by a source, prohibited by the newly issued FASCSA order.\
(ii) 
\f2\i Application at the order level. 
\f1\i0 The agency awarding the basic contract may choose to apply FASCSA orders at the order level, as implemented by the ordering activity contracting officer.\
(2) 
\f2\i Collective FASCSA orders. 
\f1\i0 If a new FASCSA order is issued collectively by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence, then the contracting officer shall modify the basic contract based upon the requirements of the order, removing any covered article, or any products or services produced or provided by a source (see \cf3 4.2303\cf4 (b)).\
(3) 
\f2\i Interagency acquisitions. 
\f1\i0 For an interagency acquisition (see subpart \cf3 17.5\cf4 ) where the funding agency differs from the awarding agency, the funding agency shall determine the applicable FASCSA orders.\
(4) 
\f2\i Inconsistencies. 
\f1\i0 If any inconsistency is identified between the basic contract and the order, then the FASCSA orders identified in the order will take precedence.\
(c) 
\f2\i Updating the solicitation or contract for new FASCSA orders. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer shall update a solicitation or contract if the program office or requiring activity determines it is necessary to:\
(1) Amend the solicitation to incorporate FASCSA orders in effect after the date the solicitation was issued but prior to contract award; or\
(2) Modify the contract to incorporate FASCSA orders issued after the date of contract award.\

\fs20 (i) Any such modification should take place within a reasonable amount of time, but no later than 6 months from the determination of the program office or requiring activity.\
(ii) If the contract is not modified within the time specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then the contract file shall be documented providing rationale why the contract could not be modified within this timeframe.\
(d) 
\f2\i Agency specific procedures. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer shall follow agency procedures for implementing FASCSA orders not identified in SAM (see \cf3 4.2303\cf4 (c)(2)).\
(e) 
\f2\i Disclosures. 
\f1\i0 If an offeror provides a disclosure pursuant to paragraph (e) of \cf3 52.204-29\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders\'97Representation and Disclosures, the contracting officer shall engage with the program office or requiring activity to determine whether to pursue a waiver, if available, in accordance with \cf3 4.2305 \cf4 and agency procedures or not award to that offeror. For FASCSA orders handled at the order level, the disclosures language is found at paragraph (b)(5) of \cf3 52.204-30\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders\'97Prohibition, with its Alternate II.\
(f) 
\f2\i Waiver. 
\f1\i0 An acquisition may be either fully or partially covered by a waiver. Partial waiver coverage occurs when\
only portions of the products or services being procured or provided by a source are covered by an applicable waiver. If the requiring activity notifies the contracting officer that the acquisition is partially covered by an approved individual waiver or class waiver under 4.2305, then the contracting officer shall work with the program office or requiring activity to identify in the solicitation, RFQ, or order, the covered articles or services produced by or provided by a source that are subject to the waiver (see \cf3 41 CFR 201\'961.304(b)\cf4 ).\
(g) 
\f2\i Reporting. 
\f1\i0 If a contractor provides a report pursuant to paragraph (c) of \cf3 52.204-30\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders\'97Prohibition, the contracting officer shall engage with the agency supply chain risk management program in accordance with agency procedures.\

\f0\b 4.2305 Waivers.\

\f1\b0 (a) An executive agency required to comply with a FASCSA order may submit a request that the order or some of its provisions not apply to\'97\
(1) The agency;\
(2) Specific actions of the agency or a specific class of acquisitions;\
(3) Actions of the agency for a period of time before compliance with the order is practicable; or (4) Other activities, as appropriate, that the requesting agency identifies.\
(b) A request for waiver shall be submitted by the executive agency in writing to the official that issued the order, unless other instructions for submission are provided by the applicable FASCSA order.\
(c) The request for waiver shall provide the following information for the issuing official to review and evaluate the request, including\'97\
(1) Identification of the applicable FASCSA order;\
(2) A description of the exception sought, including, if limited to only a portion of the order, a description of the order provisions from which an exception is sought;\
(3) The name or a description sufficient to identify the covered article or the product or service provided by a source that is subject to the order from which an exception is sought;\
(4) Compelling justification for why an exception should be granted, such as the impact of the order on the agency's ability to fulfill its mission-critical functions, or considerations related to the national interest, including national security reviews, national security investigations, or national security agreements;\
(5) Any alternative mitigations to be undertaken to reduce the risks addressed by the FASCSA order; and\
(6) Any other information requested by the issuing official.\
(d) The contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures and working with the program office or requiring\
activity, shall decide whether to pursue a waiver or to make award to an offeror that does not require a waiver in accordance with the procedures at \cf3 4.2304\cf4 (f). If a waiver is being pursued, then the contracting officer may not make an award until written approval is obtained that the waiver has been granted.\

\f0\b 4.2306 Solicitation provision and contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) In all Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts where FASCSA orders are applied at the order level, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.204-28\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders\'97Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, and Multi-Agency Contracts, in the basic contract solicitation and resultant contract (see \cf3 4.2304\cf4 (b)(1)(ii)).\
     4.19-4\

\f0\b \cf2 4.2306\
 
\f1\b0 (b) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.204-29\cf4 , Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act Orders \'97Representation and Disclosures\'97\

(1) In solicitations and contracts if the conditions specified at \cf3 4.2304\cf4 (a)(1) apply, except for Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts. For acquisitions where conditions specified at \cf3 4.2304\cf4 (a) (2) apply, then the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures for publicizing contract opportunities and award information.\

\f0\b 5.001 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Contract action
\f1\i0 , as used in this part, means an action resulting in a contract, as defined in \cf3 subpart 2.1\cf4 , including actions for additional supplies or services outside the existing contract scope, but not including actions that are within the scope and under the terms of the existing contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.\

\f0\b 5.002 Policy.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers must publicize contract actions in order to-\
(a) Increase competition;\
(b) Broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements; and\
(c) Assist small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service-disabled veteran-owned small business\
concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.\

\f0\b 5.003 Governmentwide point of entry.\

\f1\b0 For any requirement in the FAR to publish a notice, the contracting officer must transmit the notices to the GPE.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 5.1 - Dissemination of Information\

\fs20 5.101 Methods of disseminating information.\

\f1\b0 (a) As required by the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C.637(e)) \cf4 and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (\cf3 41 U.S.C.1708\cf4 ), contracting officers must disseminate information on proposed contract actions as follows:\
(1) For proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000, by synopsizing in the GPE (see \cf3 5.201\cf4 ).\
(2) For proposed contract actions expected to exceed $15,000, but not expected to exceed $25,000, by displaying in\
a public place, or by any appropriate electronic means, an unclassified notice of the solicitation or a copy of the solicitation satisfying the requirements of \cf3 5.207\cf4 (c). The notice must include a statement that all responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency. The information must be posted not later than the date the solicitation is issued, and must remain posted for at least 10 days or until after quotations have been opened, whichever is later.\
(i) If solicitations are posted instead of a notice, the contracting officer may employ various methods of satisfying the requirements of \cf3 5.207\cf4 (c). For example, the contracting officer may meet the requirements of \cf3 5.207\cf4 (c) by stamping the solicitation, by a cover sheet to the solicitation, or by placing a general statement in the display room.\
(ii) The contracting officer need not comply with the display requirements of this section when the exemptions at \cf3 5.202\cf4 (a)(1), (a)(4) through (a)(9), or (a)(11) apply, when oral solicitations are used, or when providing access to a notice of proposed contract action and solicitation through the GPE and the notice permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.\
(iii) Contracting officers may use electronic posting of requirements in a place accessible by the general public at the Government installation to satisfy the public display requirement. Contracting offices using electronic systems for public posting that are not accessible outside the installation must periodically publicize the methods for accessing the information.\
(b) In addition, one or more of the following methods may be used:\
(1) Preparing periodic handouts listing proposed contracts, and displaying them as in \cf3 5.101\cf4 (a)(2).\
(2) Assisting local trade associations in disseminating information to their members.\
(3) Making brief announcements of proposed contracts to newspapers, trade journals, magazines, or other mass\
communication media for publication without cost to the Government.\
(4) Placing paid advertisements in newspapers or other communications media, subject to the following limitations:\
(i) Contracting officers shall place paid advertisements of proposed contracts only when it is anticipated that effective competition cannot be obtained otherwise (see \cf3 5.205\cf4 (d)).\
(ii) Contracting officers shall not place advertisements of proposed contracts in a newspaper published and printed in the District of Columbia unless the supplies or services will be furnished, or the labor performed, in the District of Columbia or adjoining counties in Maryland or Virginia (\cf3 44 U.S.C.3701\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 5.102 Availability of solicitations.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the contracting officer must make available through the GPE solicitations synopsized through the GPE, including specifications, technical data, and other pertinent information determined necessary by the contracting officer. Transmissions to the GPE must be in accordance with the interface description available via the Internet at \cf3 https://www.sam.gov\cf4 .\
(2) The contracting officer is encouraged, when practicable and cost-effective, to make accessible through the GPE additional information related to a solicitation.\
(3) The contracting officer must ensure that solicitations transmitted using electronic commerce are forwarded to the GPE to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\
(4) When an agency determines that a solicitation contains information that requires additional controls to monitor access and distribution (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , technical data, specifications, maps, building designs, schedules, etc.), the information shall be made available through the enhanced controls of the GPE, unless an exception in paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies. The GPE meets the synopsis and advertising requirements of this part.\
(5) The contracting officer need not make a solicitation available through the GPE as required in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, when-\
(i) Disclosure would compromise the national security (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , would result in disclosure of classified information, or information subject to export controls) or create other security risks. The fact that access to classified matter may be necessary to submit a proposal or perform the contract does not, in itself, justify use of this exception;\
(ii) The nature of the file (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , size, format) does not make it cost-effective or practicable for contracting officers to provide access to the solicitation through the GPE; or\
(iii) The agency\'92s senior procurement executive makes a written determination that access through the GPE is not in the Government\'92s interest.\
(6) When an acquisition contains brand name specifications, the contracting officer shall include with the solicitation the justification or documentation required by \cf3 6.302-1\cf4 (c), \cf3 13.106-1\cf4 (b), or \cf3 13.501\cf4 , redacted as necessary (see \cf3 6.305\cf4 ).\
(b) When the contracting officer does not make a solicitation available through the GPE pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the contracting officer-\
(1) Should employ other electronic means (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 CD-ROM or electronic mail) whenever practicable and cost- effective. When solicitations are provided electronically on physical media (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 disks) or in paper form, the contracting officer must-\

\fs24 Subpart 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions\

\fs20 5.201 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) As required by the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C.637(e)\cf4 ) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (\cf3 41 U.S.C.1708\cf4 ), agencies must make notices of proposed contract actions available as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.\
(b) (1) For acquisitions of supplies and services, other than those covered by the exceptions in \cf3 5.202 \cf4 and the special situations in \cf3 5.205\cf4 , the contracting officer must transmit a notice to the GPE, for each proposed-\
(i) Contract action meeting the threshold in \cf3 5.101\cf4 (a)(1);\
(ii) Modification to an existing contract for additional supplies or services that meets the threshold in \cf3 5.101\cf4 (a)(1); or (iii) Contract action in any amount when advantageous to the Government.\
(2) When transmitting notices using electronic commerce, contracting officers must ensure the notice is forwarded to the GPE.\
(c) The primary purposes of the notice are to improve small business access to acquisition information and enhance competition by identifying contracting and subcontracting opportunities.\
(d) The GPE may be accessed via the Internet at \cf3 https://www.sam.gov\cf4 .\

\f0\b 5.202 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer need not submit the notice required by \cf3 5.201 \cf4 when- (a) The contracting officer determines that-\
(1) The synopsis cannot be worded to preclude disclosure of an agency\'92s needs and such disclosure would compromise the national security (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 would result in disclosure of classified information). The fact that a proposed solicitation or contract action contains classified information, or that access to classified matter may be necessary to submit a proposal or perform the contract does not, in itself, justify use of this exception to synopsis;\
(2) The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in \cf3 6.302-2 \cf4 (or, for purchases conducted\
using simplified acquisition procedures, if unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable) and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in \cf3 5.203\cf4 ;\
(3) The proposed contract action is one for which either the written direction of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the acquisition of the supplies or services for such government, or the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States and a foreign government, or international organizations, has the effect of requiring that the acquisition shall be from specified sources;\
(4) The proposed contract action is expressly authorized or required by a statute to be made through another Government agency, including acquisitions from the Small Business Administration (SBA) using the authority of section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (but see \cf3 5.205\cf4 (f)), or from a specific source such as a workshop for the blind under the rules of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled;\
(5) The proposed contract action is for utility services other than telecommunications services and only one source is available;\
(6) The proposed contract action is an order placed under subpart \cf3 16.5\cf4 . When the order contains brand-name specifications, see especially \cf3 16.505\cf4 (a)(4);\
(7) The proposed contract action results from acceptance of a proposal under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of1982 (Pub.L.97-219);\
(8) The proposed contract action results from the acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) and publication of any notice complying with \cf3 5.207 \cf4 would improperly disclose the originality of thought or innovativeness of the proposed research, or would disclose proprietary information associated with the proposal. This exception does not apply if the proposed contract action results from an unsolicited research proposal and acceptance is based solely upon the unique capability of the source to perform the particular research services proposed (see \cf3 6.302-1\cf4 (a)(2)(i));\
(9) The proposed contract action is made for perishable subsistence supplies, and advance notice is not appropriate or reasonable;\
(10) The proposed contract action is made under conditions described in \cf3 6.302-3\cf4 , or \cf3 6.302-5 \cf4 with regard to brand name commercial products for authorized resale, or \cf3 6.302-7\cf4 , and advance notice is not appropriate or reasonable;\
(11) The proposed contract action is made under the terms of an existing contract that was previously synopsized in sufficient detail to comply with the requirements of \cf3 5.207 \cf4 with respect to the current proposed contract action;\

\fs20 (12) The proposed contract action is by a Defense agency and the proposed contract action will be made and performed outside the United States and its outlying areas, and only local sources will be solicited. This exception does not apply to proposed contract actions covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or a Free Trade Agreement (see \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 );\
(13) The proposed contract action-\
(i) Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold;\
(ii) Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE;\
and\
(iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically; or\
(14) The proposed contract action is made under conditions described in \cf3 6.302-3 \cf4 with respect to the services of an expert to support the Federal Government in any current or anticipated litigation or dispute.\
(b) The head of the agency determines in writing, after consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, that advance notice is not appropriate or reasonable.\

\f0\b 5.203 Publicizing and response time.\

\f1\b0 Whenever agencies are required to publicize notice of proposed contract actions under \cf3 5.201\cf4 , they must proceed as follows:\
(a) An agency must transmit a notice of proposed contract action to the GPE (see \cf3 5.201\cf4 ). All publicizing and response times are calculated based on the date of publication. The publication date is the date the notice appears on the GPE. The notice must be published at least 15 days before issuance of a solicitation, or a proposed contract action the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of \cf3 6.302\cf4 , except that, for acquisitions of commercial products or commercial services, the contracting officer may-\
(1) Establish a shorter period for issuance of the solicitation; or\
(2) Use the combined synopsis and solicitation procedure (see \cf3 12.603\cf4 ).\
(b) The contracting officer must establish a solicitation response time that will afford potential offerors a reasonable\
opportunity to respond to each proposed contract action, (including actions where the notice of proposed contract action and solicitation information is accessible through the GPE), in an amount estimated to be greater than $25,000, but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold; or each contract action for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services in an amount estimated to be greater than $25,000. The contracting officer should consider the circumstances of the individual acquisition, such as the complexity, commerciality, availability, and urgency, when establishing the solicitation response time.\
(c) Except for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services (see \cf3 5.203\cf4 (b)), agencies shall allow at least a 30-day response time for receipt of bids or proposals from the date of issuance of a solicitation, if the proposed contract action is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(d) Agencies shall allow at least a 30 day response time from the date of publication of a proper notice of intent to contract for architect-engineer services or before issuance of an order under a basic ordering agreement or similar arrangement if the proposed contract action is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(e) Agencies must allow at least a 45-day response time for receipt of bids or proposals from the date of publication of the notice required in \cf3 5.201 \cf4 for proposed contract actions categorized as research and development if the proposed contract action is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(f) Nothing in this subpart prohibits officers or employees of agencies from responding to requests for information.\
(g) Contracting officers may, unless they have evidence to the contrary, presume the notice was published oneday\
after transmission to the GPE. This presumption does not negate the mandatory waiting or response times specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Upon learning that a particular notice has not in fact been published within the presumed timeframes, contracting officers should consider whether the date for receipt of offers can be extended or whether circumstances have become sufficiently compelling to justify proceeding with the proposed contract action under the authority of \cf3 5.202\cf4 (a)(2).\
(h) In addition to other requirements set forth in this section, for acquisitions covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or a Free Trade Agreement (see \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 ), the period of time between publication of the synopsis notice and receipt of offers must be no less than 40 days. However, if the acquisition falls within a general category identified in an annual forecast, the availability of which is published, the contracting officer may reduce this time period to as few as 10 days.\

 5.204 Presolicitation notices.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers must provide access to presolicitation notices through the GPE (see \cf3 15.201 \cf4 and \cf3 36.213-2\cf4 ). The contracting officer must synopsize a proposed contract action before issuing any resulting solicitation (see \cf3 5.201 \cf4 and \cf3 5.203\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 5.205 Special situations.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Research and development (R&D) advance notices
\f1\i0 . Contracting officers may transmit to the GPE advance notices\
of their interest in potential R&D programs whenever market research does not produce a sufficient number of concerns to obtain adequate competition. Advance notices must not be used where security considerations prohibit such publication. Advance notices will enable potential sources to learn of R&D programs and provide these sources with an opportunity\
to submit information which will permit evaluation of their capabilities. Contracting officers must consider potential\
sources which respond to advance notices for a subsequent solicitation. Advanced notices must be entitled "Research and Development Sources Sought" and include the name and telephone number of the contracting officer or other contracting activity official from whom technical details of the project can be obtained. This will enable sources to submit information for evaluation of their R&D capabilities. Contracting officers must synopsize (see \cf3 5.201\cf4 ) all subsequent solicitations for R&D contracts, including those resulting from a previously synopsized advance notice, unless one of the exceptions in \cf3 5.202 \cf4 applies.\
(b) 
\f2\i Federally Funded Research and Development Centers
\f1\i0 . Before establishing a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) (see \cf3 part 35\cf4 ) or before changing its basic purpose and mission, the sponsor must transmit at least three notices over a 90-day period to the GPE and the 
\f2\i Federal Register
\f1\i0 , indicating the agency\'92s intention to sponsor an FFRDC or change the basic purpose and mission of an FFRDC. The notice must indicate the scope and nature of the effort to be performed and request comments. Notice is not required where the action is required by law.\
(c) 
\f2\i Special notices
\f1\i0 . Contracting officers may transmit to the GPE special notices of procurement matters such as business fairs, long-range procurement estimates, prebid or preproposal conferences, meetings, and the availability of draft solicitations or draft specifications for review.\
(d) 
\f2\i Architect-engineering services
\f1\i0 . Contracting officers must publish notices of intent to contract for architect-engineering services as follows:\
(1) Except when exempted by \cf3 5.202\cf4 , contracting officers must transmit to the GPE a synopsis of each proposed contract action for which the total fee (including phases and options) is expected to exceed $25,000.\
(2) When the total fee is expected to exceed $15,000 but not exceed $25,000, the contracting officer must comply with \cf3 5.101\cf4 (a)(2). When the proposed contract action is not required to be synopsized under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the contracting officer must display a notice of the solicitation or a copy of the solicitation in a public place at the contracting office. Other optional publicizing methods are authorized in accordance with \cf3 5.101\cf4 (b).\
(e) Public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76. (1) The contracting officer shall make a formal public announcement for each streamlined or standard competition. The public announcement shall include, at a minimum, the agency, agency component, location, type of competition (streamlined or standard), activity being competed, incumbent service providers, number of Government personnel performing the activity, name of the Competitive Sourcing Official, name of the contracting officer, name of the Agency Tender Official, and projected end date of the competition.\
(2) The contracting officer shall announce the end of the streamlined or standard competition by making a formal public announcement of the performance decision. (See OMB Circular A-76.)\
(f) 
\f2\i Section8(a) competitive acquisition
\f1\i0 . When a requirement is being considered for competitive acquisition limited to eligible 8(a) participants under \cf3 subpart 19.8\cf4 , the contracting officer must transmit a synopsis of the proposed contract action to the GPE. The synopsis may be transmitted to the GPE concurrent with submission of the agency offering (see \cf3 19.804-2\cf4 ) to the Small Business Administration (SBA). The synopsis should also include information-\
(1) Advising that the acquisition is being offered for competition limited to eligible 8(a) participants;\
(2) Specifying the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code;\
(3) Advising that eligibility to participate may be restricted to 8(a) participants in either the developmental stage or the\
developmental and transitional stages; and\
(4) Encouraging interested 8(a) participants to request a copy of the solicitation as expeditiously as possible since the\
solicitation will be issued without further notice upon SBA acceptance of the requirement for the section 8(a) program. (g) 
\f2\i Notifications to the public regarding consolidation, bundling, or substantial bundling. 
\f1\i0 (1) For the requirement to\
publish a notification of consolidation or substantial bundling of contract requirements, see \cf3 7.107-5\cf4 (c) and (d).\
(2) The agency is encouraged to provide notification of the rationale for any bundled requirement to the GPE before\
issuing the solicitation of any bundled requirement (see \cf3 7.107-5\cf4 (b)).\

\fs24 Subpart 5.4 - Release of Information\

\fs20 5.401 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) A high level of business security must be maintained in order to preserve the integrity of the acquisition process. When it is necessary to obtain information from potential contractors and others outside the Government for use in preparing Government estimates, contracting officers shall ensure that the information is not publicized or discussed with potential contractors.\
(b) Contracting officers may make available maximum information to the public, except information-\
(1) On plans that would provide undue or discriminatory advantage to private or personal interests;\
(2) Received in confidence from an offeror;\
(3) Otherwise requiring protection under Freedom of Information Act (see \cf3 subpart 24.2\cf4 ) or Privacy Act (see \cf3 subpart\
24.1\cf4 ); or\
(4) Pertaining to internal agency communications (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 technical reviews, contracting authority or other reasons, or\
recommendations referring thereto).\
(c) This policy applies to all Government personnel who participate directly or indirectly in any stage of the acquisition\
cycle.\

\f0\b 5.402 General public.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers shall process requests for specific information from the general public, including suppliers, in accordance with \cf3 subpart 24.1 \cf4 or \cf3 24.2\cf4 , as appropriate.\

\f0\b 5.403 Requests from Members of Congress.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers shall give Members of Congress, upon their request, detailed information regarding any particular contract. When responsiveness would result in disclosure of classified matter, business confidential information, or information prejudicial to competitive acquisition, the contracting officer shall refer the proposed reply, with full documentation, to the agency head and inform the legislative liaison office of the action.\

\f0\b 5.404 Release of long-range acquisition estimates.\

\f1\b0 To assist industry planning and to locate additional sources of supply, it may be desirable to publicize estimates of unclassified long-range acquisition requirements. Estimates may be publicized as far in advance as possible.\

\f0\b 5.404-1 Release procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . The agency head, or a designee, may release long-range acquisition estimates if the information will- (1) Assist industry in its planning and facilitate meeting the acquisition requirements;\
(2) Not encourage undesirable practices (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 attempts to corner the market or hoard industrial materials); and\
(3) Not indicate the existing or potential mobilization of the industry as a whole.\
(b) 
\f2\i Conditions
\f1\i0 . The agency head shall ensure that-\
(1) Classified information is released through existing security channels in accordance with agency security regulations; (2) The information is publicized as widely as practicable to all parties simultaneously by any of the means described in\
this part;\
(3) Each release states that-\
(i) The estimate is based on the best information available;\
(ii) The information is subject to modification and is in no way binding on the Government; and\
(iii) More specific information relating to any individual item or class of items will not be furnished until the\
proposed action is synopsized through the GPE or the solicitation is issued;\
(4) Each release contains the name and address of the contracting officer that will process the acquisition;\
(5) Modifications to the original release are publicized as soon as possible, in the same manner as the original; and (6) Each release-\
(i) Is coordinated in advance with small business, public information, and public relations personnel, as appropriate;\
(ii) Contains, if applicable, a statement that small business set-asides may be involved, but that a determination can be made only when acquisition action is initiated; and\

\fs20 (iii) Contains the name or description of the item, and the estimated quantity to be acquired by calendar quarter, fiscal year, or other period. It may also contain such additional information as the number of units last acquired, the unit price, and the name of the last supplier.\

\f0\b 5.404-2 Announcements of long-range acquisition estimates.\

\f1\b0 Further publicizing, consistent with the needs of the individual case, may be accomplished by announcing through the GPE that long-range acquisition estimates have been published and are obtainable, upon request, from the contracting officer.\

\f0\b 5.405 Exchange of acquisition information.\

\f1\b0 (a) When the same item or class of items is being acquired by more than one agency, or by more than one contracting activity within an agency, the exchange and coordination of pertinent information, particularly cost and pricing data, between these agencies or contracting activities is necessary to promote uniformity of treatment of major issues and the resolution of particularly difficult or controversial issues. The exchange and coordination of information is particularly beneficial during the period of acquisition planning, presolicitation, evaluation, and pre-award survey.\
(b) When substantial acquisitions of major items are involved or when the contracting activity deems it desirable, the contracting activity shall request appropriate information (on both the end item and on major subcontracted components) from other agencies or contracting activities responsible for acquiring similar items. Each agency or contracting activity receiving such a request shall furnish the information requested. The contracting officer, early in a negotiation of a contract, or in connection with the review of a subcontract, shall request the contractor to furnish information as to the contractor\'92s or subcontractor\'92s previous Government contracts and subcontracts for the same or similar end items and major subcontractor components.\

\f0\b 5.406 Public disclosure of justification documents for certain contract actions.\

\f1\b0 (a) Justifications and approvals for other than full and open competition must be posted in accordance with \cf3 6.305\cf4 .\
(b) Limited-source justifications (excluding brand name) for FSS orders or blanket purchase agreements with an estimated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold must be posted in accordance with \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 (a)(2).\
(c) Justifications for task or delivery orders greater than the simplified acquisition threshold and awarded without providing for fair opportunity must be posted in accordance with \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(2)(ii)(D).\

 5.501 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 5.5 - Paid Advertisements\

\f2\i\b0\fs20 Advertisement 
\f1\i0 means any single message prepared for placement in communication media, regardless of the number of placements.\

\f2\i Publication 
\f1\i0 means\'96\
(1) The placement of an advertisement in a newspaper, magazine, trade or professional journal, or any other printed\
medium; or\
(2) The broadcasting of an advertisement over radio or television.\

\f0\b 5.502 Authority.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Newspapers. 
\f1\i0 Authority to approve the publication of paid advertisements in newspapers is vested in the head of each agency (\cf3 44 U.S.C.3702\cf4 ). This approval authority may be delegated (\cf3 5 U.S.C.302(b)\cf4 ). Contracting officers shall obtain written authorization in accordance with policy procedures before advertising in newspapers.\
(b) 
\f2\i Other media. 
\f1\i0 Unless the agency head determines otherwise, advance written authorization is not required to place advertisements in media other than newspapers.\

\f0\b 5.503 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) General. (1) Orders for paid advertisements may be placed directly with the media or through an advertising agency. Contracting officers shall give small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns maximum opportunity to participate in these acquisitions.\
(2) The contracting officer shall use the \cf3 SF 1449 \cf4 for paper solicitations. The \cf3 SF 1449 \cf4 shall be used to make awards or place orders unless the award/order is made by using electronic commerce or by using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card for micropurchases.\
(b) 
\f2\i Rates. 
\f1\i0 Advertisements may be paid for at rates not over the commercial rates charged private individuals, with the usual discounts (\cf3 44 U.S.C. 3703\cf4 ).\
(c) 
\f2\i Proof of advertising. 
\f1\i0 Every invoice for advertising shall be accompanied by a copy of the advertisement or an affidavit of publication furnished by the publisher, radio or television station, or advertising agency concerned (\cf3 44 U.S.C. 3703\cf4 ). Paying offices shall retain the proof of advertising until the Government Accountability Office settles the paying office\'92s account.\
(d) 
\f2\i Payment. 
\f1\i0 Upon receipt of an invoice supported by proof of advertising, the contracting officer shall attach a copy of the written authority (see \cf3 5.502\cf4 (a)) and submit the invoice for payment under agency procedures.\

\f0\b 5.504 Use of advertising agencies.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General. 
\f1\i0 Basic ordering agreements may be placed with advertising agencies for assistance in producing and placing advertisements when a significant number will be placed in several publications and in national media. Services of advertising agencies include, but are not limited to, counseling as to selection of the media for placement of the advertisement, contacting the media in the interest of the Government, placing orders, selecting and ordering typography, copywriting, and preparing rough layouts.\
(b) 
\f2\i Use of commission-paying media. 
\f1\i0 The services of advertising agencies in placing advertising with media often can be obtained at no cost to the Government, over and above the space cost, as many media give advertising agencies a commission or discount on the space cost that is not given to the Government.\
(c) 
\f2\i Use of noncommission-paying media. 
\f1\i0 Some media do not grant advertising agencies a commission or discount, meaning the Government can obtain the same rate as the advertising agency. If the advertising agency agrees to place advertisements in noncommission-paying media as a no-cost service, the basic ordering agreement shall so provide. If the advertising agency will not agree to place advertisements at no cost, the agreement shall-\
(1) Provide that the Government may place orders directly with the media; or\
(2) Specify an amount that the Government will pay if the agency places the orders.\
(d) 
\f2\i Art work, supplies, and incidentals. 
\f1\i0 The basic ordering agreement also may provide for the furnishing by the advertising agency of art work, supplies, and incidentals, including brochures and pamphlets, but not their printing.\
"Incidentals" may include telephone calls, and postage incurred by the advertising agency on behalf of the Government.\

\fs24 Subpart 5.7 - Publicizing Requirements Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\

\fs20 5.701 Scope.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes posting requirements for presolicitation and award notices for actions funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act). The requirements of this subpart enhance transparency to the public.\

\f0\b 5.702 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 This subpart applies to all actions expected to exceed $25,000 funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act. Unlike subparts \cf3 5.2 \cf4 and \cf3 5.3\cf4 , this subpart includes additional requirements for orders and for actions that are not both fixed-price and competitive.\

\f0\b 5.703 Definition.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Task or delivery order contract 
\f1\i0 means a "delivery order contract," and a "task order contract," as defined in \cf3 16.501-1\cf4 . For example, it includes Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), multi-agency contracts (MACs), and other indefinite- delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts, whether single award or multiple award. It also includes Federal Supply Schedule contracts (including Blanket Purchase Agreements under \cf3 subpart 8.4\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 5.704 Publicizing preaward.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Follow the publication procedures at \cf3 5.201\cf4 .\
(2) In addition, notices of proposed contract actions are required for orders exceeding $25,000, funded in whole or\
in part by the Recovery Act, which are issued under task or delivery order contracts. This does not include modifications to existing orders, but these modifications are covered postaward, see \cf3 5.705\cf4 . These notices are for "informational purposes only," therefore, \cf3 5.203 \cf4 does not apply. Contracting officers should concurrently use their usual solicitation practice (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , \cf2 eBuy).\
(b) Contracting officers shall identify proposed contract actions, funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, by using the following instructions which are also available in the Recovery FAQs under "Buyers/Engineers" at the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) ( \cf3 https://www.sam.gov \cf4 ):\
(1) If submitting notices electronically via ftp or email, enter the word "Recovery" as the first word in the title field.\
(2) If using the GPE directly, select the "yes" radio button for the "Is this a Recovery and Reinvestment Act action" field on the "Notice Details" form (Step 2) located below the "NAICS Code" field. In addition, enter the word "Recovery" as the first word in the title field.\
(c) In preparing the description required by \cf3 5.207\cf4 (a)(16), use clear and concise language to describe the planned procurement. Use descriptions of the goods and services (including construction), that can be understood by the general public. Avoid the use of acronyms or terminology that is not widely understood by the general public.\

\f0\b 5.705 Publicizing postaward.\

\f1\b0 Follow usual publication procedures at \cf3 5.301\cf4 , except that the following supersede the exceptions at \cf3 5.301\cf4 (b)(2) through (7):\
(a) (1) Publicize the award notice for any action exceeding $500,000, funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, including-\
(i) Contracts;\
(ii) Modifications to existing contracts;\
(iii) Orders which are issued under task or delivery order contracts; and (iv) Modifications to orders under task or delivery order contracts.\
(2) Contracting officers shall identify contract actions, funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, by using the following instructions which are also available in the Recovery FAQS under "Buyers/Engineers" at the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) ( \cf3 https://www.sam.gov \cf4 ):\
(i) If submitting notices electronically via ftp or email, enter the word "Recovery" as the first word in the title field.\

Avoid the use of acronyms or terminology that is not widely understood by the general public.\
(b) Regardless of dollar value, if the contract action, including all modifications and orders under task or delivery order contracts, is not both fixed-price and competitively awarded, publicize the award notice and include in the description the rationale for using other than a fixed-priced and/or competitive approach. Include in the description a statement specifically noting if the contract action was not awarded competitively, or was not fixed-price, or was neither competitive nor fixed- price. These notices and the rationale will be available to the public at the GPE, so do not include any proprietary information or information that would compromise national security.

\fs24 Subpart 6.1 - Full and Open Competition\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes the policy and procedures that are to be used to promote and provide for full and open competition.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3201 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3301 \cf4 require, with certain limited exceptions (see \cf3 subpart 6.2 \cf4 and \cf3 6.3\cf4 ), that contracting officers shall promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding Government contracts.\
(b) Contracting officers shall provide for full and open competition through use of the competitive procedure(s) contained in this subpart that are best suited to the circumstances of the contract action and consistent with the need to fulfill the Government\'92s requirements efficiently ( \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3201 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3301\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 6.102 Use of competitive procedures.\

(b) 
\f2\i Competitive proposals
\f1\i0 . (See \cf3 6.401\cf4 (b).) If sealed bids are not appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section,\
contracting officers shall request competitive proposals or use the other competitive procedures under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.\
(c) 
\f2\i Combination of competitive procedures
\f1\i0 . If sealed bids are not appropriate, contracting officers may use any combination of competitive procedures (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 two-step sealed bidding).\
(d) Other competitive procedures. (1) Selection of sources for architect-engineer contracts in accordance with the provisions of \cf3 40 U.S.C. 1102 
\f2\i \cf4 et seq
\f1\i0 . is a competitive procedure (see \cf3 subpart 36.6 \cf4 for procedures).\
(2) Competitive selection of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement is a competitive procedure if award results from-\

\fs24 Subpart 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition\

\fs20 6.300 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures, and identifies the statutory authorities, for contracting without providing for full and open competition.\

\f0\b 6.301 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 41 U.S.C.3304 \cf4 and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204 \cf4 each authorize, under certain conditions, contracting without providing for full and open competition. The Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration are subject to \'93 \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204\cf4 . Other executive agencies are subject to \cf3 41 U.S.C.3304\cf4 . Contracting without providing for full and open competition or full and open competition after exclusion of sources is a violation of statute, unless permitted by one of the exceptions in \cf3 6.302\cf4 .\
(b) Each contract awarded without providing for full and open competition shall contain a reference to the specific authority under which it was so awarded. Contracting officers shall use the U.S. Code citation applicable to their agency. (See \cf3 6.302\cf4 .)\
(c) Contracting without providing for full and open competition shall not be justified on the basis of-\
(1) A lack of advance planning by the requiring activity; or\
(2) Concerns related to the amount of funds available (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 funds will expire) to the agency or activity for the\
acquisition of supplies or services.\
(d) When not providing for full and open competition, the contracting officer shall solicit offers from as many potential\
sources as is practicable under the circumstances.\
(e) For contracts under this subpart, the contracting officer shall use the contracting procedures prescribed in \cf3 6.102\cf4 (a) or\
(b), if appropriate, or any other procedures authorized by this regulation.\

\f0\b 6.302 Circumstances permitting other than full and open competition.\

\f1\b0 The following statutory authorities (including applications and limitations) permit contracting without providing for full and open competition. Requirements for justifications to support the use of these authorities are in \cf3 6.303\cf4 .\

\f0\b 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Authority. (1) Citations: \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1) \cf4 or \cf3 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1)\cf4 .\
(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD,\
NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.\
(i) Supplies or services may be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that-\
(A) Demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see definition at \cf3 2.101\cf4 ), or, demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the particular research services proposed;\
(B) Offers a concept or services not otherwise available to the Government; and\
(C) Does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive acquisition. (See \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204(b)(A) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3304(b)(1)\cf4 .)\
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-\
         or\
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition;\
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency\'92s requirements. (See \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204(b)(B) \cf4 or \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3304(b)\
  (2)\cf4 .)\
(iii) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in\
the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-\
or\
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency\'92s requirements. (See \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204(b)(B)\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . This authority shall be used, if appropriate, in preference to the authority in \cf3 6.302-7\cf4 ; it shall not be used when any of the other circumstances is applicable. Use of this authority may be appropriate in situations such as the following (these examples are not intended to be all inclusive and do not constitute authority in and of themselves):\
(1) When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency\'92s minimum needs can only be satisfied by-\
(i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; or\
(ii) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number\
of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.\
(2) The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw\
material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source (however, the mere existence of such rights or circumstances does not in and of itself justify the use of these authorities) (see \cf3 part 27\cf4 ).\
(3) When acquiring utility services (see \cf3 41.101\cf4 ), circumstances may dictate that only one supplier can furnish the service (see \cf3 41.202\cf4 ); or when the contemplated contract is for construction of a part of a utility system and the utility company itself is the only source available to work on the system.\
(4) When the agency head has determined in accordance with the agency\'92s standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency\'92s needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available.\
(c) Application for brand-name descriptions. (1) An acquisition or portion of an acquisition that uses a brand-name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand-name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer-\
(i) Does not provide for full and open competition, regardless of the number of sources solicited; and (ii) Shall be justified and approved in accordance with \cf3 6.303 \cf4 and \cf3 6.304\cf4 .\
(A) If only a portion of the acquisition is for a brand-name product or item peculiar to one manufacturer, the justification and approval is to cover only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name or peculiar to one manufacturer. The justification should state it is covering only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name or peculiar to one manufacturer, and the approval level requirements will then only apply to that portion;\
(B) The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition or portion of an acquisition is essential to the Government\'92s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company; and\
(C) The justification shall be posted with the solicitation (see \cf3 5.102\cf4 (a)(6)).\
(2) Brand-name or equal descriptions, and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer\
products other than those specifically referenced by brand-name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use.\
(d) Limitations. (1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in \cf3 6.303 \cf4 and \cf3 6.304\cf4 .\
(2) For contracts awarded using this authority, the notices required by \cf3 5.201 \cf4 shall have been published and any bids, proposals, quotations, or capability statements must have been considered.\

(2) When the agency\'92s need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the\
Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . This authority applies in those situations where-\
(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition; and\
(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.\
(c) Limitations. (1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in \cf3 6.303 \cf4 and \cf3 6.304\cf4 . These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.\
(2) This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.\
(d) Period of Performance. (1) The total period of performance of a contract awarded or modified using this authority- (i) May not exceed the time necessary-\
(A) To meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the work to be performed under the contract; and\

(ii) May not exceed one year, including all options, unless the head of the agency determines that exceptional circumstances apply. This determination must be documented in the contract file.\
(2) (i) Any subsequent modification using this authority, which will extend the period of performance beyond one year under this same authority, requires a separate determination. This determination is only required if the cumulative period of performance using this authority exceeds one year. This requirement does not apply to the exercise of options previously addressed in the determination required at paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.\
(ii) The determination shall be approved at the same level as the level to which the agency head authority in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)of this section is delegated.\
(3) The requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall apply to any contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(4) The determination of exceptional circumstances is in addition to the approval of the justification in \cf3 6.304\cf4 .\

and employees' skills, or maintain active engineering, research, or development work;\
(iii) Maintain properly balanced sources of supply for meeting the requirements of acquisition programs in the\
interest of industrial mobilization (when the quantity required is substantially larger than the quantity that must be awarded in order to meet the objectives of this authority, that portion not required to meet such objectives will be acquired by providing for full and open competition, as appropriate, under this part);\
(iv) Create or maintain the required domestic capability for production of critical supplies by limiting competition to items manufactured in-\
(A) The United States or its outlying areas; or\
(B) The United States, its outlying areas, or Canada.\
(v) Continue in production, contractors that are manufacturing critical items, where there would otherwise be a break\
in production; or\

 6.304 Approval of the justification.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except for paragraph (b) of this section, the justification for other than full and open competition shall be approved in writing-\
(1) For a proposed contract not exceeding $750,000, the contracting officer\'92s certification required by \cf3 6.303-2\cf4 (b)(12) will serve as approval unless a higher approving level is established in agency procedures.\
(2) For a proposed contract over $750,000 but not exceeding $15 million, by the advocate for competition for the procuring activity designated pursuant to \cf3 6.501 \cf4 or an official described in paragraph (a)(3) or (4)of this section. This authority is not delegable.\
(3) For a proposed contract over $15 million, but not exceeding $75 million, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, not exceeding $100 million, by the head of the procuring activity, or a designee who-\
(i) If a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer; or\
(ii) If a civilian, is serving in a position in a grade above GS-15 under the General Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule).\
(4) For a proposed contract over $75 million or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, over $100 million, by the senior procurement executive of the agency designated pursuant to \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1702(c) \cf4 in accordance with agency procedures.This authority is not delegable except in the case of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, acting as the senior procurement executive for the Department of Defense.\
(b) Any justification for a contract awarded under the authority of \cf3 6.302-7\cf4 , regardless of dollar amount, shall be considered approved when the determination required by \cf3 6.302-7\cf4 (c)(1) is made.\
(c) A class justification for other than full and open competition shall be approved in writing in accordance with agency procedures. The approval level shall be determined by the estimated total value of the class.\
(d) The estimated dollar value of all options shall be included in determining the approval level of a justification.\

\f0\b 6.305 Availability of the justification.\

\f1\b0 (a) The agency shall make publicly available the justification required by \cf3 6.303-1 \cf4 as required by \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3204(f) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3304(f)\cf4 . Except for the circumstances in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the justification shall be made publicly available within 14 days after contract award.\
(b) In the case of a contract award permitted under \cf3 6.302-2\cf4 , the justification shall be posted within 30 days after contract award.\
(c) In the case of a brand name justification under \cf3 6.302-1\cf4 (c), the justification shall be posted with the solicitation (see \cf3 5.102\cf4 (a)(6)).\
(d) The justifications shall be made publicly available-\
(1) At the Government Point of Entry (GPE) \cf3 https://www.sam.gov\cf4 .\
(2) On the website of the agency, which may provide access to the justifications by linking to the GPE; and (3) Must remain posted for a minimum of 30 days.\
(e) Contracting officers shall carefully screen all justifications for contractor proprietary data and remove all such data,\
and such references and citations as are necessary to protect the proprietary data, before making the justifications available for public inspection. Contracting officers shall also be guided by the exemptions to disclosure of information contained in the Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C. 552\cf4 ) and the prohibitions against disclosure in \cf3 24.202 \cf4 in determining whether the justification, or portions of it, are exempt from posting. Although the submitter notice process set out in EO 12600, entitled "Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information," does not apply, if the justification appears to contain proprietary data, the contracting officer should provide the contractor that submitted the information an opportunity to review the justification for proprietary data, before making the justification available for public inspection, redacted as necessary. This process must not prevent or delay the posting of the justification in accordance with the timeframes required in paragraphs (a) through (c).\
(f) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) do not apply if posting the justification would disclose the executive agency\'92s needs and disclosure of such needs would compromise national security or create other security risks.\

\fs20 6.401 Sealed bidding and competitive proposals.\

\f1\b0 Sealed bidding and competitive proposals, as described in \cf3 parts 14 \cf4 and \cf3 15\cf4 , are both acceptable procedures for use under \cf3 subparts 6.1\cf4 ,\cf3 6.2\cf4 ; and, when appropriate, under \cf3 subpart 6.3\cf4 .\
(a) 
\f2\i Sealed bids
\f1\i0 . (See \cf3 part 14 \cf4 for procedures.) Contracting officers shall solicit sealed bids if-\
(1) Time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;\
(2) The award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;\
(3) It is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding offerors about their bids; and (4) There is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid.\
(b) Competitive proposals. (See \cf3 part 15 \cf4 for procedures.) (1) Contracting officers may request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section.\
(2) Because of differences in areas such as law, regulations, and business practices, it is generally necessary to conduct discussions with offerors relative to proposed contracts to be made and performed outside the United States and its outlying areas. Competitive proposals will therefore be used for these contracts unless discussions are not required and the use of sealed bids is otherwise appropriate.\

 7.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures for-\
(a) Developing acquisition plans;\
(b) Determining whether to use commercial or Government resources for acquisition of supplies or services; (c) Deciding whether it is more economical to lease equipment rather than purchase it; and\
(d) Determining whether functions are inherently governmental.\

\f0\b 7.101 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 7.1 - Acquisition Plans\

\f2\i\b0\fs20 Acquisition streamlining 
\f1\i0 means any effort that results in more efficient and effective use of resources to design and develop, or produce quality systems. This includes ensuring that only necessary and cost-effective requirements are included, at the most appropriate time in the acquisition cycle, in solicitations and resulting contracts for the design, development, and production of new systems, or for modifications to existing systems that involve redesign of systems or subsystems.\

\f2\i Life-cycle cost 
\f1\i0 means the total cost to the Government of acquiring, operating, supporting, and (if applicable) disposing of the items being acquired.\

\f2\i Order 
\f1\i0 means an order placed under a-\
(1) Federal Supply Schedule contract; or\
(2) Task-order contract or delivery-order contract awarded by another agency, (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 Governmentwide acquisition\
contract or multi-agency contract).\

\f2\i Planner 
\f1\i0 means the designated person or office responsible for developing and maintaining a written plan, or for the\
planning function in those acquisitions not requiring a written plan.\

\f0\b 7.102 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall perform acquisition planning and conduct market research (see \cf3 part 10\cf4 ) for all acquisitions in order to promote and provide for\'97\
(1) Acquisition of commercial products or commercial services, or to the extent that commercial products suitable to meet the agency\'92s needs are not available, nondevelopmental items, to the maximum extent practicable (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3453 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3307\cf4 ); and\
(2) Full and open competition (see \cf3 part 6\cf4 ) or, when full and open competition is not required in accordance with \cf3 part 6\cf4 , to obtain competition to the maximum extent practicable, with due regard to the nature of the supplies or services to be\
acquired (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(a)(1) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3306a)(1)\cf4 ).\
(3) Selection of appropriate contract type in accordance with \cf3 part 16\cf4 ; and\
(4) Appropriate consideration of the use of pre-existing contracts, including interagency and intra-agency contracts, to\
fulfill the requirement, before awarding new contracts. (See \cf3 8.002 \cf4 through \cf3 8.004 \cf4 and \cf3 subpart 17.5\cf4 ).\
(b) This planning shall integrate the efforts of all personnel responsible for significant aspects of the acquisition. The\
purpose of this planning is to ensure that the Government meets its needs in the most effective, economical, and timely manner. Agencies that have a detailed acquisition planning system in place that generally meets the requirements of \cf3 7.104 \cf4 and \cf3 7.105 \cf4 need not revise their system to specifically meet all of these requirements.\

\f0\b 7.103 Agency-head responsibilities.\

\f1\b0 The agency head or a designee shall prescribe procedures f or the following:\
(a) Promoting and providing for full and open competition (see \cf3 part 6\cf4 ) or, when full and open competition is not required in accordance with \cf3 part 6\cf4 , for obtaining competition to the maximum extent practicable, with due regard to the nature of the supplies and services to be acquired (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(a)(1) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3306(a)(1)\cf4 ).\
(b) Encouraging offerors to supply commercial products or commercial services, or to the extent that commercial products suitable, to meet the agency needs are not available, nondevelopmental items in response to agency solicitations (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3453 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3307\cf4 ).\
(c) Ensuring that acquisition planners address the requirement to specify needs, develop specifications, and to solicit offers in such a manner to promote and provide for full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the supplies and services to be acquired (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(a)(1) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3306(a)(1)\cf4 ).

\fs20 (d) Ensuring that acquisition planners document the file to support the selection of the contract type in accordance with subpart \cf3 16.1\cf4 .\
(e) Establishing criteria and thresholds at which increasingly greater detail and formality in the planning process is required as the acquisition becomes more complex and costly, including for cost-reimbursement and other high-risk contracts (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , other than firm-fixed-price contracts) requiring a written acquisition plan. A written plan shall be prepared for cost reimbursement and other high-risk contracts other than firm-fixed-price contracts, although written plans may be required for firm-fixed-price contracts as appropriate.\
(f) Ensuring that the statement of work is closely aligned with performance outcomes and cost estimates.\
(g) Writing plans either on a systems basis, on an individual contract basis, or on an individual order basis, depending upon the acquisition.\
(h) Ensuring that the principles of this subpart are used, as appropriate, for those acquisitions that do not require a written plan as well as for those that do.\
(i) Designating planners for acquisitions.\
(j) Reviewing and approving acquisition plans and revisions to these plans to ensure compliance with FAR requirements including \cf3 7.104 \cf4 and part \cf3 16\cf4 . For other than firm-fixed-price contracts, ensuring that the plan is approved and signed at least one level above the contracting officer.\
(k) Establishing criteria and thresholds at which design-to-cost and life-cycle-cost techniques will be used.\
(l) Establishing standard acquisition plan formats, if desired, suitable to agency needs.\
(m) Waiving requirements of detail and formality, as necessary, in planning for acquisitions having compressed delivery or\
performance schedules because of the urgency of the need.\
(n) Assuring that the contracting officer, prior to contracting, reviews:\
(1) The acquisition history of the supplies and services; and\
(2) A description of the supplies, including, when necessary for adequate description, a picture, drawing, diagram, or other graphic representation.\
(o) Ensuring that agency planners include use of the metric system of measurement in proposed acquisitions in accordance with \cf3 15 U.S.C.205b \cf4 (see \cf3 11.002\cf4 (b)) and agency metric plans and guidelines.\
(p) \cf2 Ensuring that agency planners-\
(1) Comply with the policy in \cf3 11.002\cf2 (d) regarding procurement of sustainable products and services (as defined in\
\cf3 2.101\cf2 ) in accordance with subpart \cf3 23.1\cf2 ;\
(2) Comply with the Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings and Associated Instructions (Guiding\
Principles), for the design, construction, renovation, repair, or deconstruction of Federal buildings (see 36.104). The Guiding Principles can be accessed at 
\f2\i \cf3 https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/guiding_principles_for_sustainable_federal_buildings.pdf\cf2 ; 
\f1\i0 and\
(3) Require contractor compliance with Federal environmental requirements, when the contractor is operating Government-owned facilities or vehicles, to the same extent as the agency would be required to comply if the agency operated the facilities or vehicles.\
(q) Ensuring that acquisition planners specify needs and develop plans, drawings, work statements, specifications, or other product or service requirements (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , help desks, call centers, training services, and automated self-service technical support) descriptions that address information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility standards (see \cf3 36 CFR 1194.1\cf4 ) in proposed acquisitions and that these standards are included in requirements planning (see \cf3 subpart 39.2\cf4 ).\
(r) Making a determination, prior to issuance of a solicitation for advisory and assistance services involving the analysis and evaluation of proposals submitted in response to a solicitation, that a sufficient number of covered personnel with the training and capability to perform an evaluation and analysis of proposals submitted in response to a solicitation are not readily available within the agency or from another Federal agency in accordance with the guidelines at \cf3 37.204\cf4 .\
(s) Ensuring that no purchase request is initiated or contract entered into that would result in the performance of an inherently governmental function by a contractor and that all contracts or orders are adequately managed so as to ensure effective official control over contract or order performance.\
(t) Ensuring that knowledge gained from prior acquisitions is used to further refine requirements and acquisition strategies. For services, greater use of performance-based acquisition methods should occur for follow-on acquisitions.\
(u) Ensuring that acquisition planners, to the maximum extent practicable-\
(1) Structure contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns; and\
(2) Avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling that precludes small business participation as contractors (see \cf3 7.107\cf4 )\

\f1\b0 (a) Acquisition planning should begin as soon as the agency need is identified, preferably well in advance of the fiscal year in which contract award or order placement is necessary. In developing the plan, the planner shall form a team consisting of all those who will be responsible for significant aspects of the acquisition, such as contracting, small business, fiscal,\
legal, and technical personnel. If contract performance is to be in a designated operational area or supporting a diplomatic or consular mission, the planner shall also consider inclusion of the combatant commander or chief of mission, as appropriate. The planner should review previous plans for similar acquisitions and discuss them with the key personnel involved in those acquisitions. At key dates specified in the plan or whenever significant changes occur, and no less often than annually, the planner shall review the plan and, if appropriate, revise it.\
(b) Requirements and logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements on an urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules, since it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Early in the planning process,\
the planner should consult with requirements and logistics personnel who determine type, quality, quantity, and delivery requirements.\
(c) The planner shall coordinate with and secure the concurrence of the contracting officer in all acquisition planning. If the plan proposes using other than full and open competition when awarding a contract, the plan shall also be coordinated with the cognizant advocate for competition.\
(d) The planner shall coordinate the acquisition plan or strategy with the cognizant small business specialist when the strategy contemplates an acquisition meeting the thresholds in \cf3 7.107-4 \cf4 for substantial bundling unless the contract or task order or delivery order is totally set-aside for small business under \cf3 part 19\cf4 . The small business specialist shall notify the agency Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization or the Office of Small Business Programs if the strategy involves-\
(1) Bundling that is unnecessary or unjustified; or\
(2) Bundled or consolidated requirements not identified as such by the agency (see \cf3 7.107\cf4 ).\
(e) The planner shall ensure that a COR is nominated as early as practicable in the acquisition process by the requirements\
official or in accordance with agency procedures. The contracting officer shall designate and authorize a COR as early as practicable after the nomination. See \cf3 1.602-2\cf4 (d).\

\f0\b 7.105 Contents of written acquisition plans.\

\f1\b0 In order to facilitate attainment of the acquisition objectives, the plan must identify those milestones at which decisions should be made (see paragraph (b)(21) of this section). The plan must address all the technical, business, management, and other significant considerations that will control the acquisition. The specific content of plans will vary, depending on the nature, circumstances, and stage of the acquisition. In preparing the plan, the planner must follow the applicable instructions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, together with the agency\'92s implementing procedures. Acquisition plans for service contracts or orders must describe the strategies for implementing performance-based acquisition methods or must provide rationale for not using those methods (see \cf3 subpart 37.6\cf4 ).\
(a) 
\f2\i Acquisition background and objectives
\f1\i0 - (1) 
\f2\i Statement of need
\f1\i0 . Introduce the plan by a brief statement of need. Summarize the technical and contractual history of the acquisition. Discuss feasible acquisition alternatives, the impact of prior acquisitions on those alternatives, and any related in-house effort.\
(2) 
\f2\i Applicable conditions
\f1\i0 . State all significant conditions affecting the acquisition, such as- (i) Requirements for compatibility with existing or future systems or programs; and\
(ii) Any known cost, schedule, and capability or performance constraints.\

\fs20 (3) 
\f2\i Cost. 
\f1\i0 Set forth the established cost goals for the acquisition and the rationale supporting them, and discuss related cost concepts to be employed, including, as appropriate, the following items:\
(i) 
\f2\i Life-cycle cost
\f1\i0 . Discuss how life-cycle cost will be considered. If it is not used, explain why. If appropriate, discuss the cost model used to develop life-cycle-cost estimates.\
(ii) 
\f2\i Design-to-cost
\f1\i0 . Describe the design-to-cost objective(s) and underlying assumptions, including the rationale for quantity, learning-curve, and economic adjustment factors. Describe how objectives are to be applied, tracked, and enforced. Indicate specific related solicitation and contractual requirements to be imposed.\
(iii) 
\f2\i Application of should-cost
\f1\i0 . Describe the application of should-cost analysis to the acquisition (see \cf3 15.407-4\cf4 ). (4) 
\f2\i Capability or performance
\f1\i0 . Specify the required capabilities or performance characteristics of the supplies or the\
performance standards of the services being acquired and state how they are related to the need.\
(5) 
\f2\i Delivery or performance-period requirements
\f1\i0 . Describe the basis for establishing delivery or performance-period\
requirements (see \cf3 subpart 11.4\cf4 ). Explain and provide reasons for any urgency if it results in concurrency of development and production or constitutes justification for not providing for full and open competition.\
(6) 
\f2\i Trade-offs
\f1\i0 . Discuss the expected consequences of trade-offs among the various cost, capability or performance, and schedule goals.\
(7) 
\f2\i Risks
\f1\i0 . Discuss technical, cost, and schedule risks and describe what efforts are planned or underway to reduce risk and the consequences of failure to achieve goals. If concurrency of development and production is planned, discuss its effects on cost and schedule risks.\
(8) 
\f2\i Acquisition streamlining
\f1\i0 . If specifically designated by the requiring agency as a program subject to acquisition streamlining, discuss plans and procedures to-\
(i) Encourage industry participation by using draft solicitations, presolicitation conferences, and other means of stimulating industry involvement during design and development in recommending the most appropriate application and tailoring of contract requirements;\
(ii) Select and tailor only the necessary and cost-effective requirements; and\
(iii) State the timeframe for identifying which of those specifications and standards, originally provided for guidance only, shall become mandatory.\
(b) Plan of action\'97\
(1) 
\f2\i Sources
\f1\i0 . (i) Indicate the prospective sources of supplies or services that can meet the need.\
(ii) Consider required sources of supplies or services (see \cf3 part 8\cf4 ) and sources identifiable through databases including the Governmentwide database of contracts and other procurement instruments intended for use by multiple agencies available at \cf3 https://www.contractdirectory.gov/contractdirectory/\cf4 .\
(iii) Include consideration of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns (see \cf3 part 19\cf4 ).\
(iv) Consider the impact of any consolidation or bundling that might affect participation of small businesses in the acquisition (see \cf3 7.107\cf4 ) (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 644(e) \cf4 and \cf3 15 U.S.C. 657q\cf4 ). When the proposed acquisition strategy involves bundling, identify the incumbent contractors and contracts affected by the bundling.\
(v) Address the extent and results of the market research and indicate their impact on the various elements of the plan (see \cf3 part 10\cf4 ).\
(2) Competition. (i) Describe how competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained throughout the course of the acquisition. If full and open competition is not contemplated, cite the authority in \cf3 6.302\cf4 , discuss the basis for the application of that authority, identify the source(s), and discuss why full and open competition cannot be obtained.\
(ii) Identify the major components or subsystems. Discuss component breakout plans relative to these major components or subsystems. Describe how competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained for these components or subsystems.\
(iii) Describe how competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained for spares and repair parts. Identify the key logistic milestones, such as technical data delivery schedules and acquisition method coding conferences, that affect competition.\
(iv) When effective subcontract competition is both feasible and desirable, describe how such subcontract competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained throughout the course of the acquisition. Identify any known barriers to increasing subcontract competition and address how to overcome them.\
(3) 
\f2\i Contract type selection
\f1\i0 . Discuss the rationale for the selection of contract type. For other than firm-fixed-price contracts, see \cf3 16.103\cf4 (d) for additional documentation guidance. Acquisition personnel shall document the acquisition plan with findings that detail the particular facts and circumstances, (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , complexity of the requirements, uncertain duration\

\f1\b0 of the work, contractor\'92s technical capability and financial responsibility, or adequacy of the contractor\'92s accounting system), and associated reasoning essential to support the contract type selection. The contracting officer shall ensure that requirements and technical personnel provide the necessary documentation to support the contract type selection.\
(4) 
\f2\i Source-selection procedures. 
\f1\i0 Discuss the source selection procedures for the acquisition, including the timing for submission and evaluation of proposals, and the relationship of evaluation factors to the attainment of the acquisition objectives (see \cf3 subpart 15.3\cf4 ). When an EVMS is required (see FAR \cf3 34.202\cf4 (a)) and a pre-award IBR is contemplated, the acquisition plan must discuss-\
(i) How the pre-award IBR will be considered in the source selection decision;\
(ii) How it will be conducted in the source selection process (see FAR \cf3 15.306\cf4 ); and\
(iii) Whether offerors will be directly compensated for the costs of participating in a pre-award IBR.\
(5) Acquisition considerations. (i) For each contract contemplated, discuss use of multiyear contracting, options,\
or other special contracting methods (see \cf3 part 17\cf4 ); any special clauses, special solicitation provisions, or FAR deviations required (see \cf3 subpart 1.4\cf4 ); whether sealed bidding or negotiation will be used and why; whether equipment will be acquired by lease or purchase (see \cf3 subpart 7.4\cf4 ) and why; and any other contracting considerations. Provide rationale if a performance- based acquisition will not be used or if a performance-based acquisition for services is contemplated on other than a firm- fixed-price basis (see \cf3 37.102\cf4 (a), \cf3 16.103\cf4 (d), and \cf3 16.505\cf4 (a)(3)).\
(ii) For each order contemplated, discuss-\
(A) For information technology acquisitions, how the capital planning and investment control requirements of\
\cf3 40 U.S.C. 11312 \cf4 and OMB Circular A-130 will be met (see \cf3 7.103\cf4 (v) and \cf3 part 39\cf4 ); and (B) Why this action benefits the Government, such as when-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 The agency can accomplish its mission more efficiently and effectively (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 take advantage of the servicing agency\'92s specialized expertise; or gain access to contractors with needed expertise); or\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Ordering through an indefinite delivery contract facilitates access to small business concerns, including small disadvantaged business concerns, 8(a) contractors, women-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.\
(iii) For information technology acquisitions using Internet Protocol, discuss whether the requirements documents include the Internet Protocol compliance requirements specified in \cf3 11.002\cf4 (g) or a waiver of these requirements has been granted by the agency\'92s Chief Information Officer.\
(iv) For information technology acquisitions, identify the applicable ICT accessibility standard(s). When an exception or an exemption to the standard(s) applies, the plan must list the exception and/or exemption, and the item(s) to which it applies. For those items listing \cf3 39.204 \cf4 or \cf3 39.205\cf4 (a)(1) or (2), the corresponding accessibility standard does not need to be identified. See \cf3 subpart 39.2 \cf4 and \cf3 36 CFR 1194.1\cf4 .\
(v) For each contract (and order) contemplated, discuss the strategy to transition to firm-fixed-price contracts to the maximum extent practicable. During the requirements development stage, consider structuring the contract requirements, 
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , line items, in a manner that will permit some, if not all, of the requirements to be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis, either in the current contract, future option years, or follow-on contracts. This will facilitate an easier transition to a firm-fixed-price contract, because a cost history will be developed for a recurring definitive requirement.\
(6) 
\f2\i Budgeting and funding. 
\f1\i0 Include budget estimates, explain how they were derived, and discuss the schedule for obtaining adequate funds at the time they are required (see \cf3 subpart 32.7\cf4 ).\
(7) 
\f2\i Product or service descriptions. 
\f1\i0 Explain the choice of product or service description types (including performance- based acquisition descriptions) to be used in the acquisition.\
(8) 
\f2\i Priorities, allocations, and allotments
\f1\i0 . When urgency of the requirement dictates a particularly short delivery or performance schedule, certain priorities may apply. If so, specify the method for obtaining and using priorities, allocations, and allotments, and the reasons for them (see \cf3 subpart 11.6\cf4 ).\
(9) 
\f2\i Contractor versus Government performance
\f1\i0 . Address the consideration given to OMB CircularNo.A-76 (see \cf3 subpart 7.3\cf4 ).\
(10) 
\f2\i Inherently governmental functions
\f1\i0 . Address the consideration given to \cf3 subpart 7.5\cf4 .\
(11) 
\f2\i Management information requirements
\f1\i0 . Discuss, as appropriate, what management system will be used by\
the Government to monitor the contractor\'92s effort. If an Earned Value Management System is to be used, discuss the methodology the Government will employ to analyze and use the earned value data to assess and monitor contract performance. In addition, discuss how the offeror\'92s/contractor\'92s EVMS will be verified for compliance with the Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748 (EIA-748), Earned Value Management Systems, and the timing and conduct of integrated baseline reviews (whether prior to or post award). (See \cf3 34.202\cf4 .)\

\f0\b 7.106 Additional requirements for major systems.\

\f1\b0 (a) In planning for the solicitation of a major system (see \cf3 part 34\cf4 ) development contract, planners shall consider requiring offerors to include, in their offers, proposals to incorporate in the design of a major system-\
(1) Items which are currently available within the supply system of the agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source; and\
(2) Items which the Government will be able to acquire competitively in the future if they are likely to be needed in substantial quantities during the system\'92s service life.\
(b) In planning for the solicitation of a major system (see \cf3 part 34\cf4 ) production contract, planners shall consider requiring offerors to include, in their offers, proposals identifying opportunities to assure that the Government will be able to obtain, on a competitive basis, items acquired in connection with the system that are likely to be acquired in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirements may include the following:\
(1) Proposals to provide the Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive future acquisitions, together with the cost to the Government, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.\
(2) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for competitive future acquisitions. (c) In determining whether to apply paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, planners shall consider the purposes for which\
the system is being acquired and the technology necessary to meet the system\'92s required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the contracting officer shall consider them in evaluating competing offers. In noncompetitive awards, the factors in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may be considered by the contracting officer as objectives in negotiating the contract.\

\f0\b 7.107 Additional requirements for acquisitions involving consolidation, bundling, or substantial bundling.\
7.107-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the requirement is considered both consolidated and bundled, the agency shall follow the guidance regarding bundling in \cf3 7.107-3\cf4 , \cf3 7.107-4\cf4 , and \cf3 7.107-5\cf4 .\
(b) The requirements of this section \cf3 7.107 \cf4 do not apply-\
(1) If a cost comparison analysis will be performed in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 (except \cf3 7.107-4 \cf4 still\
applies);\
(2) To orders placed under single-agency task-order contracts or delivery-order contracts, when the requirement was\
considered in determining that the consolidation or bundling of the underlying contract was necessary and justified; or\
(3) To requirements for which there is a mandatory source (see \cf3 8.002 \cf4 or \cf3 8.003\cf4 ), including supplies and services that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled or the\
Schedule of Products issued by Federal Prison Industries, Inc. This exception does not apply\'96\
(i) When the requiring agency obtains a waiver in accordance with \cf3 8.604 \cf4 or an exception in accordance with \cf3 8.605\
\cf4 or \cf3 8.706\cf4 ; or\
(ii) When optional acquisitions of supplies and services permitted under \cf3 8.713 \cf4 are included.\

\f0\b 7.107-2 Consolidation.\

\f1\b0 (a) Consolidation may provide substantial benefits to the Government. However, because of the potential impact on small business participation, before conducting an acquisition that is a consolidation of requirements with an estimated total dollar\

\fs20 value exceeding $2 million, the senior procurement executive (SPE) or chief acquisition officer (CAO) shall make a written determination that the consolidation is necessary and justified in accordance with \cf3 15 U.S.C. 657q\cf4 , after ensuring that-\
(1) Market research has been conducted;\
(2) Any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation have been identified; (3) The determination is coordinated with the agency's Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization or the\
Office of Small Business Programs;\
(4) Any negative impact by the acquisition strategy on contracting with small business concerns has been identified;\
and\
(5) Steps are taken to include small business concerns in the acquisition strategy.\
(b) The SPE or CAO may determine that the consolidation is necessary and justified if the benefits of the acquisition would substantially exceed the benefits that would be derived from each of the alternative contracting approaches identified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, including benefits that are quantifiable in dollar amounts as well as any other specifically identified benefits.\
(c) Such benefits may include cost savings or price reduction and, regardless of whether quantifiable in dollar amounts- (1) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency;\
(2) Reduction in acquisition cycle times;\
(3) Better terms and conditions; or\
(4) Any other benefit. (d) Benefits.\
(1) Benefits that are quantifiable in dollar amounts are substantial if individually, in combination, or in the aggregate the anticipated financial benefits are equivalent to-\
(i) Ten percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) if the value is $94 million or less; or\
(ii) Five percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, if the value exceeds $94 million.\
(2) Benefits that are not quantifiable in dollar amounts shall be specifically identified and otherwise quantified to the extent feasible.\
(3) Reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone is not sufficient justification for consolidation unless the cost savings are expected to be at least 10 percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) of the consolidated requirements, as determined by the SPE or CAO (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 657q(c)(2)(B)\cf4 ).\
(e) (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, the approving authority identified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section may determine that consolidation is necessary and justified when-\
(i) The expected benefits do not meet the thresholds for a substantial benefit at paragraph (d)(1) of this section but are critical to the agency's mission success; and\
(ii) The procurement strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business. (2) The approving authority is\'96\
(i) For the Department of Defense, the SPE: or\
(ii) For the civilian agencies, the Deputy Secretary or equivalent.\
(f) If a determination is made that consolidation is necessary and justified, the contracting officer shall include it in the\
acquisition strategy documentation and provide it to the Small Business Administration (SBA) upon request.\

\f0\b 7.107-3 Bundling.\

\f1\b0 (a) Bundling may provide substantial benefits to the Government. However, because of the potential impact on small business participation, before conducting an acquisition strategy that involves bundling, the agency shall make a written determination that the bundling is necessary and justified in accordance with \cf3 15 U.S.C. 644(e)\cf4 . A bundled requirement is considered necessary and justified if the agency would obtain measurably substantial benefits as compared to meeting its agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts or orders.\
(b) The agency shall quantify the specific benefits identified through the use of market research and other techniques to explain how their impact would be measurably substantial (see \cf3 10.001\cf4 (a)(2)(iv) and (a)(3)(vii)).\
(c) Such benefits may include, but are not limited to-\
(1) Cost savings;\
(2) Price reduction;\
(3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency; (4) Reduction in acquisition cycle times, or\

(2) Five percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, if the\
value exceeds $94 million.\
(e) Reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone is not sufficient justification for bundling unless the cost\
savings are expected to be at least ten percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options) of the bundled requirements.\
(f) (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this subsection, the approving authority identified in paragraph (f)(2) of this subsection may determine that bundling is necessary and justified when\
(i) The expected benefits do not meet the thresholds for a substantial benefit but are critical to the agency's mission success; and\
(ii) The acquisition strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business concerns. (2) The approving authority, without power of delegation, is\'96\
(i) For the Department of Defense, the senior procurement executive; or\
(ii) For the civilian agencies is the Deputy Secretary or equivalent.\
(g) In assessing whether cost savings and/or price reduction would be achieved through bundling, the agency and SBA\
shall-\
(1) Compare the price that has been charged by small businesses for the work that they have performed; or\
(2) Where previous prices are not available, compare the price, based on market research, that could have been or could\
be charged by small businesses for the work previously performed by other than a small business.\
(h) If a determination is made that bundling is necessary and justified, the contracting officer shall include it in the\
acquisition strategy documentation and provide it to SBA upon request.\

\fs24 Subpart 7.2 - Planning for the Purchase of Supplies in Economic Quantities\

\fs20 7.200 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for gathering information from offerors to assist the Government in planning the most advantageous quantities in which supplies should be purchased.\

\f0\b 7.201 [Reserved]\
7.202 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies are required by \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3242 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3310 \cf4 to procure supplies in such quantity as-\
(1) Will result in the total cost and unit cost most advantageous to the Government, where practicable; and (2) Does not exceed the quantity reasonably expected to be required by the agency.\
(b) Each solicitation for a contract for supplies is required, if practicable, to include a provision inviting each offeror responding to the solicitation-\
(1) To state an opinion on whether the quantity of the supplies proposed to be acquired is economically advantageous to the Government; and\
(2) If applicable, to recommend a quantity or quantities which would be more economically advantageous to the Government. Each such recommendation is required to include a quotation of the total price and the unit price for supplies procured in each recommended quantity.\

\f0\b 7.203 Solicitation provision.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.207-4\cf4 , Economic Purchase Quantity-Supplies, in solicitations for supplies. The provision need not be inserted if the solicitation is for a contract under the General Services Administration\'92s multiple award schedule contract program, or if the contracting officer determines that-\
(a) The Government already has the data;\
(b) The data is otherwise readily available; or\
(c) It is impracticable for the Government to vary its future requirements.\

\f0\b 7.204 Responsibilities of contracting officers.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers are responsible for transmitting offeror responses to the solicitation provision at \cf3 52.207-4 \cf4 to appropriate inventory management/requirements development activities in accordance with agency procedures. The economic purchase quantity data so obtained are intended to assist inventory managers in establishing and evaluating economic order quantities for supplies under their cognizance.\
(b) In recognition of the fact that economic purchase quantity data furnished by offerors are only one of many data inputs required for determining the most economical order quantities, contracting officers should generally take no action to revise quantities to be acquired in connection with the instant procurement. However, if a significant price variation is evident from offeror responses, and the potential for significant savings is apparent, the contracting officer shall consult with the cognizant inventory manager or requirements development activity before proceeding with an award or negotiations. If this consultation discloses that the Government should be ordering an item of supply in different quantities and the inventory manager/requirements development activity concurs, the solicitation for the item should be amended or canceled and a new requisition should be obtained.\

\fs24 Subpart 7.4 - Equipment Acquisition\

\fs20 7.400 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart\'97\
(a) Implements section 555 of the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) Reauthorization Act of 2018 (\cf3 Pub. L. 115-254\cf4 ); (b) Provides guidance when acquiring equipment and more than one method of acquisition is available for use; and\
(c) Applies to both the initial acquisition of equipment and the renewal or extension of existing equipment leases or rental\
agreements.\

\f0\b 7.401 Acquisition considerations.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Agencies shall acquire equipment using the method of acquisition most advantageous to the Government based on a case-by-case analysis of comparative costs and other factors in accordance with this subpart and agency procedures.\
(2) The methods of acquisition to be compared in the analysis shall include, at a minimum\'97 (i) Purchase;\
(ii) Short-term rental or lease;\
(iii) Long-term rental or lease;\
(iv) Interagency acquisition (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ); and\
(v) Agency acquisition agreements, if applicable, with a State or local government. (b) (1) The factors to be compared in the analysis shall include, at a minimum:\
(i) Estimated length of the period the equipment is to be used and the extent of use within that period;\
(ii) Financial and operating advantages of alternative types and makes of equipment;\
(iii) Cumulative rent, lease, or other periodic payments, however described, for the estimated period of use; (iv) Net purchase price;\
(v) Transportation, installation, and storage costs;\
(vi) Maintenance, repair, and other service costs; and\
(vii) Potential obsolescence of the equipment because of imminent technological improvements.\
(2) The following additional factors should be considered, as appropriate, depending on the type, cost, complexity, and estimated period of use of the equipment:\
(i) Availability of purchase options.\
(ii) Cancellation, extension, and early return conditions and fees.\
(iii) Ability to swap out or exchange equipment.\
(iv) Available warranties.\
(v) Insurance, environmental, or licensing requirements.\
(vi) Potential for use of the equipment by other agencies after its use by the acquiring agency is ended.\
(vii) Trade-in or salvage value.\
(viii) Imputed interest.\
(ix) Availability of a servicing capability, especially for highly complex equipment; 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , can the equipment be\
serviced by the Government or other sources if it is purchased? (c) The analysis in paragraph (a) is not required\'97\
(1) When the President has issued an emergency declaration or a major disaster declaration pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (\cf3 42 U.S.C. 5121 
\f2\i \cf4 et seq.
\f1\i0 );\
(2) In other emergency situations if the agency head makes a determination that obtaining such equipment is necessary in order to protect human life or property; or\
(3) When otherwise authorized by law.\

\f0\b 7.402 Acquisition methods.\

\f1\b0 (a) Purchase method. (1) Generally, the purchase method is appropriate if the equipment will be used beyond the point in time when cumulative rental or leasing costs exceed the purchase costs.\
(2) Agencies should not rule out the purchase method of equipment acquisition in favor of renting or leasing merely because of the possibility that future technological advances might make the selected equipment less desirable.\
(b) 
\f2\i Rent or lease method. 
\f1\i0 (1) The rent or lease method is appropriate if it is to the Government's advantage under the circumstances. The rent or lease method may also serve as a short-term measure when the circumstances\'97\
(i) Require immediate use of equipment to meet program or system goals; but\

\fs20 (ii) Do not currently support acquisition by purchase.\
(2) If a rent or lease method is justified, a rental or lease agreement with option to purchase is preferable.\
(3) Generally, a long term rental or lease agreement should be avoided, but may be appropriate if an option to purchase\
or other favorable terms are included.\
(4) If a rental or lease agreement with option to purchase is used, the contract shall state the purchase price or provide a\
formula which shows how the purchase price will be established at the time of purchase.\

\f0\b 7.403 General Services Administration assistance and OMB guidance.\

\f1\b0 (a) When requested by an agency, the General Services Administration (GSA) will assist in rent, lease, or purchase decisions by providing information such as-\

(3) New techniques; and\
(4) Industry or market trends.\
(b) For additional GSA assistance and guidance, agencies may\'97\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules\

\f2\i\b0\fs20 Ordering activity 
\f1\i0 means an activity that is authorized to place orders, or establish blanket purchase agreements (BPA), against the General Services Administration\'92s (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule contracts. A list of eligible ordering activities is available at \cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/schedules \cf4 (click "For Customers Ordering from Schedules" and then "Eligibility to Use GSA Sources").\

\f2\i Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 
\f1\i0 means contracts awarded by GSA or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for similar or comparable supplies, or services, established with more than one supplier, at varying prices. The primary statutory authorities for the MAS program are \cf3 41 U.S.C. 152(3)\cf4 , Competitive Procedures, and \cf3 40 U.S.C. 501\cf4 , Services for Executive Agencies.\

\f2\i Requiring agency 
\f1\i0 means the agency needing the supplies or services.\

\f2\i Schedules e-Library 
\f1\i0 means the on-line source for GSA and VA Federal Supply Schedule contract award information. Schedules e-Library may be accessed at \cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/elibrary\cf4 .\

\f2\i Special Item Number (SIN) 
\f1\i0 means a group of generically similar (but not identical) supplies or services that are intended to serve the same general purpose or function.\

\f0\b 8.402 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Federal Supply Schedule program is also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The Federal Supply Schedule program is directed and managed by GSA and provides Federal agencies (see \cf3 8.004\cf4 ) with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and commercial services at prices associated with volume buying. Indefinite delivery contracts are awarded to provide supplies and services at stated prices for given periods of time. GSA may delegate certain responsibilities to other agencies (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 GSA has delegated authority to the VA to procure medical supplies under the VA Federal Supply Schedules program). Orders issued under the VA Federal Supply Schedule program are covered by this subpart. Additionally, the Department of Defense (DoD) manages similar systems of schedule-type contracting for military items; however, DoD systems are not covered by this subpart.\
(b) GSA schedule contracts require all schedule contractors to publish an "Authorized Federal Supply Schedule\
Pricelist" (pricelist). The pricelist contains all supplies and services offered by a schedule contractor. In addition, each pricelist contains the pricing and the terms and conditions pertaining to each Special Item Number that is on schedule.\
The schedule contractor is required to provide one copy of its pricelist to any ordering activity upon request. Also,\
a copy of the pricelist may be obtained from the Federal Supply Service by submitting a written e-mail request to \cf3 schedules.infocenter@gsa.gov \cf4 or by telephone at 1-800-488-3111. This subpart, together with the pricelists, contain necessary information for placing delivery or task orders with schedule contractors. In addition, the GSA schedule contracting office issues Federal Supply Schedules publications that contain a general overview of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program and address pertinent topics. Ordering activities may request copies of schedules publications by contacting the Centralized Mailing List Service through the Internet at \cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/cmls\cf4 , submitting written e-mail requests to \cf3 CMLS@gsa.gov\cf4 ; or by completing GSA Form 457, FSS Publications Mailing List Application, and mailing it to the GSA Centralized Mailing List Service (7 SM), P.O. Box 6477, Fort Worth, TX 76115. Copies of GSA Form 457 may also be obtained from the above-referenced points of contact.\
(c) (1) GSA offers an on-line shopping service called "GSA Advantage!" through which ordering activities may place orders against Schedules. (Ordering activities may also use GSA Advantage! to place orders through GSA\'92s Global Supply System, a GSA wholesale supply source, formerly known as "GSA Stock" or the "Customer Supply Center." FAR \cf3 subpart\
8.4 \cf4 is not applicable to orders placed through the GSA Global Supply System.) Ordering activities may access GSA Advantage! through the GSA Federal Supply Service Home Page (\cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/fas\cf4 ) or the GSA Federal Supply Schedule Home Page at \cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/schedules\cf4 .\
(2) GSA Advantage! enables ordering activities to search specific information (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 national stock number, part number, common name), review delivery options, place orders directly with Schedule contractors (except see \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 ) and pay for orders using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card.\
(d) \cf2 (1) 
\f2\i eBuy, 
\f1\i0 GSA's electronic request for quotation (RFQ) system, is a part of a suite of online tools which complement GSA Advantage!. GSA's eBuy allows ordering activities to post requirements, obtain quotes, and issue orders electronically. Posting an RFQ on eBuy\'97\

\cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/schedules\cf4 . Additionally, for on-line training courses regarding the Schedules Program, review the following website: \cf3 http://www.gsa.gov/training\cf4 .\
(f) For administrative convenience, an ordering activity contracting officer may add items not on the Federal Supply Schedule (also referred to as open market items) to a Federal Supply Schedule blanket purchase agreement (BPA) or an individual task or delivery order only if-\
(1) All applicable acquisition regulations pertaining to the purchase of the items not on the Federal Supply Schedule have been followed (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 publicizing (\cf3 part 5\cf4 ), competition requirements (\cf3 part 6\cf4 ), acquisition of commercial products or commercial services (\cf3 part 12\cf4 ), contracting methods (\cf3 parts 13\cf4 , \cf3 14\cf4 , and \cf3 15\cf4 ), and small business programs (\cf3 part 19\cf4 ));\
(2) The ordering activity contracting officer has determined the price for the items not on the Federal Supply Schedule is fair and reasonable;\
(3) The items are clearly labeled on the order as items not on the Federal Supply Schedule and they conform to the rules for numbering line items at subpart \cf3 4.10\cf4 ; and\
(4) All clauses applicable to items not on the Federal Supply Schedule are included in the order.\
(g) When using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment, orders at or below the micro-\
purchase threshold are exempt from verification in the System for Award Management as to whether the contractor has a delinquent debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP).\

\f0\b 8.403 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) Procedures in this subpart apply to\'97\
(1) Individual orders for supplies or services placed against Federal Supply Schedules contracts; and (2) BPAs established against Federal Supply Schedule contracts.\
(b) GSA may establish special ordering procedures for a particular schedule. In this case, that schedule will specify those special ordering procedures. Unless otherwise noted, special ordering procedures established for a Federal Supply Schedule take precedence over the procedures in \cf3 8.405\cf4 .\
Note: GSA-established ordering procedures for Order-Level Materials can be found at \cf3 GSAR subpart 538-72 \cf4 .\
(c) In accordance with section 1427(b) of Public Law 108-136 (\cf3 40 U.S.C. 1103 \cf4 note), for requirements that substantially or to a dominant extent specify performance of architect-engineer services (as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 ), agencies\'97\
(1) Shall use the procedures at \cf3 subpart 36.6\cf4 ; and\
(2) Shall not place orders for such requirements under a Federal Supply Schedule.\

\f0\b 8.404 Use of Federal Supply Schedules.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . \cf3 parts 13 \cf4 (except \cf3 13.303-2\cf4 (c)(3)), \cf3 14\cf4 , \cf3 15\cf4 , and \cf3 19 \cf4 (except for the requirements at \cf3 19.102\cf4 (b)(3) and \cf3 19.202-1\cf4 (e) (1)(iii)) do not apply to BPAs or orders placed against Federal Supply Schedules contracts (but see \cf3 8.405-5\cf4 ). BPAs and orders placed against a MAS, using the procedures in this subpart, are considered to be issued using full and open competition (see \cf3 6.102\cf4 (d)(3)). Therefore, when establishing a BPA (as authorized by \cf3 13.303-2\cf4 (c)(3)), or placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of \cf3 8.405\cf4 , ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement; but see paragraph (g) of this section.\
(b) (1) The contracting officer, when placing an order or establishing a BPA, is responsible for applying the regulatory and statutory requirements applicable to the agency for which the order is placed or the BPA is established. The requiring agency shall provide the information on the applicable regulatory and statutory requirements to the contracting officer responsible for placing the order.\
(2) For orders over $600,000, see subpart \cf3 17.5 \cf4 for additional requirements for interagency acquisitions. (c) 
\f2\i Acquisition planning. 
\f1\i0 Orders placed under a Federal Supply Schedule contract-\
(1) Are not exempt from the development of acquisition plans (see \cf3 subpart 7.1\cf4 ), and an information technology acquisition strategy (see \cf3 part 39\cf4 );\
(2) Shall comply with all FAR requirements for a consolidated or bundled contract when the order meets the definition at \cf3 2.101 \cf2 of "consolidation" or "bundling"; and\

\f1\b0 (3) Must, whether placed by the requiring agency, or on behalf of the requiring agency, be consistent with the requiring agency\'92s statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the acquisition of the supply or service.\
(d) 
\f2\i Pricing
\f1\i0 . Supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices. Services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates, or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 installation, maintenance, and repair). GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by \cf3 8.405-2\cf4 (d). By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in \cf3 8.405\cf4 , the ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government\'92s needs. Although GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing, ordering activities may seek additional discounts before placing an order (see \cf3 8.405-4\cf4 ).\
(e) The procedures under subpart \cf3 33.1 \cf4 are applicable to the issuance of an order or the establishment of a BPA against a schedule contract.\
(f) If the ordering activity issues an RFQ, the ordering activity shall provide the RFQ to any schedule contractor that requests a copy of it.\
(g) (1) Ordering activities shall publicize contract actions funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5):\
(i) Notices of proposed MAS orders (including orders issued under BPAs) that are for "informational purposes only" exceeding $25,000 shall follow the procedures in \cf3 5.704 \cf4 for posting orders.\
(ii) Award notices for MAS orders (including orders issued under BPAs) shall follow the procedures in \cf3 5.705\cf4 . (2) When an order is awarded or a Blanket Purchase Agreement is established with an estimated value greater than\
the simplified acquisition threshold and supported by a limited-source justification at 
\f2\i \cf3 8.405-6 
\f1\i0 \cf4 (a), the ordering activity contracting officer must-\
(i) Publicize the action (see \cf3 5.301\cf4 ); and\
(ii) Post the justification in accordance with 
\f2\i \cf3 8.405-6 
\f1\i0 \cf4 (a)(2).\
(h) Type-of-order preference for services. (1) The ordering activity shall specify the order type (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , firm-fixed price, time-\
and-materials, or labor-hour) for the services offered on the schedule priced at hourly rates.\
(2) Agencies shall use fixed-price orders for the acquisition of commercial services to the maximum extent practicable. (3) (i) A time-and-materials or labor-hour order may be used for the acquisition of commercial services only when it\
is not possible at the time of placing the order to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.\
(ii) Prior to the issuance of a time-and-materials or labor-hour order, the contracting officer shall-\
(A) Execute a determination and findings (D&F) for the order, in accordance with paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this\
section that a fixed-price order is not suitable;\
(B) Include a ceiling price in the order that the contractor exceeds at its own risk; and\
(C) When the total performance period, including options, is more than three years, the D&F prepared in\
accordance with this paragraph shall be signed by the contracting officer and approved by the head of the contracting activity prior to the execution of the base period.\
(iii) The D&F required by paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify that a fixed-price order is not suitable. At a minimum, the D&F shall-\
(A) Include a description of the market research conducted (see \cf3 8.404\cf4 (c) and \cf3 10.002\cf4 (e));\
(B) Establish that it is not possible at the time of placing the order to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence;\
(C) Establish that the current requirement has been structured to maximize the use of fixed-price orders (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , by limiting the value or length of the time-and-materials/labor-hour order; or, establishing fixed prices for portions of the requirement) on future acquisitions for the same or similar requirements; and\
(D) Describe actions to maximize the use of fixed-price orders on future acquisitions for the same requirements. (iv) Prior to an increase in the ceiling price of a time-and-materials or labor-hour order, the ordering activity shall-\
(A) Conduct an analysis of pricing and other relevant factors to determine if the action is in the best interest of the Government and document the order file;\
(B) Follow the procedures at \cf3 8.405-6 \cf4 for a change that modifies the general scope of the order; and (C) Comply with the requirements at \cf3 8.402\cf4 (f) when modifying an order to add open market items.\

\fs20 (i) Ensure that service contractor reporting requirements are met in accordance with \cf3 subpart 4.17\cf4 , Service Contracts Inventory.\
(j) Line items. When placing orders or establishing BPAs, ordering activities shall reference the special item number and the corresponding line or subline item awarded (established per \cf3 4.1005\cf4 ) in the schedule. If an ordering activity contracting officer adds an item not on the Federal Supply Schedule in accordance with \cf3 8.402\cf4 (f), establish a new line item in accordance with \cf3 subpart 4.10\cf4 .\

\f0\b 8.405 Ordering procedures for Federal Supply Schedules.\

\f1\b0 Ordering activities shall use the ordering procedures of this section when placing an order or establishing a BPA for supplies or services. The procedures in this section apply to all schedules. For establishing BPAs and for orders under BPAs see \cf3 8.405-3\cf4 .\

\f0\b 8.405-1 Ordering procedures for supplies, and services not requiring a statement of work.\

\f1\b0 (a) Ordering activities shall use the procedures of this subsection when ordering supplies and services that are listed in the schedules contracts at a fixed price for the performance of a specific task, where a statement of work is not required (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 installation, maintenance, and repair). For establishing BPAs and for orders under BPAs see \cf3 8.405-3\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold
\f1\i0 . Ordering activities may place orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold with any Federal Supply Schedule contractor that can meet the agency\'92s needs. Although not required to solicit from a specific number of schedule contractors, ordering activities should attempt to distribute orders among contractors.\
(c) 
\f2\i Orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold
\f1\i0 . Ordering activities shall place orders with the schedule contractor that can provide the supply or service that represents the best value. Before placing an order, an ordering activity shall:\
(1) Consider reasonably available information about the supply or service offered under MAS contracts by surveying at least three schedule contractors through the GSA Advantage! on-line shopping service, by reviewing the catalogs or pricelists of at least three schedule contractors, or by requesting quotations from at least three schedule contractors (see \cf3 8.405-5 \cf4 ); or\
(2) Document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at \cf3 8.405-6 \cf4 (a);\
(d) For proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(1) Each order shall be placed on a competitive basis in accordance with (d)(2) and (3) of this section, unless this\
requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 
\f2\i \cf3 8.405-6 
\f1\i0 \cf4 .\
(2) The ordering activity contracting officer shall provide an RFQ that includes a description of the supplies to be\
delivered or the services to be performed and the basis upon which the selection will be made (see \cf3 8.405-1\cf4 (f)). (3) The ordering activity contracting officer shall -\
(i) Post the \cf2 RFQ on eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required supplies or services under the appropriate multiple award schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or\
(ii) Provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirement, the contracting officer shall prepare a written determination explaining that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirement could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\
(4) The ordering activity contracting officer shall ensure that all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the basis for selection in the RFQ.\
(e) When an order contains brand-name specifications, the contracting officer shall post the RFQ on eBuy along with the justification or documentation, as required by \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 . An RFQ is required when a purchase description specifies a brand- name.\
(f) In addition to price (see \cf3 8.404 \cf4 (d) and \cf3 8.405-4\cf4 ), when determining best value, the ordering activity may consider, among other factors, the following:\
(1) Past performance.\
(2) Special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance. (3) Trade-in considerations.\
(4) Probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item.\
(5) Warranty considerations.\

\f0\b 8.405-2 Ordering procedures for services requiring a statement of work.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . Ordering activities shall use the procedures in this subsection when ordering services priced at hourly rates as established by the schedule contracts. The applicable services will be identified in the Federal Supply Schedule publications and the contractor\'92s pricelists. For establishing BPAs and for orders under BPAs see \cf3 8.405-3\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Statements of Work (SOWs)
\f1\i0 . All Statements of Work shall include a description of work to be performed; location of work; period of performance; deliverable schedule; applicable performance standards; and any special requirements (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 security clearances, travel, special knowledge). To the maximum extent practicable, agency requirements shall be performance-based statements (see \cf3 subpart 37.6\cf4 ).\
(c) 
\f2\i Request for Quotation procedures
\f1\i0 . The ordering activity must provide the \cf2 request for quotation (RFQ), which includes the statement of work and evaluation criteria (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 experience and past performance), to schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency\'92s needs. The RFQ may be posted to GSA\'92s electronic RFQ system, eBuy (see \cf3 8.402\cf4 (d)).\
(1) 
\f2\i Orders at, or below, the micro-purchase threshold
\f1\i0 . Ordering activities may place orders at, or below, the micro- purchase threshold with any Federal Supply Schedule contractor that can meet the agency\'92s needs. The ordering activity should attempt to distribute orders among contractors.\
(2) 
\f2\i For orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. 
\f1\i0 (i) The ordering activity shall develop a statement of work, in accordance with \cf3 8.405-2\cf4 (b).\
(ii) The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the statement of work and evaluation criteria) to at least three schedule contractors that offer services that will meet the agency\'92s needs or document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at 
\f2\i \cf3 8.405-6 
\f1\i0 \cf4 (a).\
(iii) The ordering activity shall specify the type of order (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , firm-fixed-price, labor-hour) for the services identified in the statement of work. The contracting officer should establish firm-fixed-prices, as appropriate.\
(3) For proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. In addition to meeting the requirements of \cf3 8.405-2\cf4 (c)(2)(i) and (iii), the following procedures apply:\
(i) Each order shall be placed on a competitive basis in accordance with (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, unless this requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with 
\f2\i \cf3 8.405-6 
\f1\i0 \cf4 .\
(ii) The ordering activity contracting officer shall provide an RFQ that includes a statement of work and the evaluation criteria.\
(iii) The ordering activity contracting officer shall-\
(A) Post the RFQ on \cf2 eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required services under the appropriate\
multiple-award schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or\
(B) Provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate\
to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirements, the contracting officer shall prepare a written determination to explain that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirements could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\
(C) Ensure all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the RFQ.\
(4) The ordering activity shall provide the RFQ (including the statement of work and the evaluation criteria) to any schedule contractor who requests a copy of it.\
(d) 
\f2\i Evaluation
\f1\i0 . The ordering activity shall evaluate all responses received using the evaluation criteria provided to the schedule contractors. The ordering activity is responsible for considering the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to\

Place the order with the schedule contractor that represents the best value (see \cf3 8.404\cf4 (d) and \cf3 8.405-4\cf4 ). After award, ordering activities should provide timely notification to unsuccessful offerors. If an unsuccessful offeror requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the award decision shall be provided.\
(e) 
\f2\i Use of time-and-materials and labor-hour orders for services
\f1\i0 . When placing a time-and-materials or labor-hour order for services, see \cf3 8.404\cf4 (h).\
(f) Minimum documentation. The ordering activity shall document-\
(1) The schedule contracts considered, noting the contractor from which the service was purchased; (2) A description of the service purchased;\
(3) The amount paid;\
(4) The evaluation methodology used in selecting the contractor to receive the order;\
(5) The rationale for any tradeoffs in making the selection;\
(6) The price reasonableness determination required by paragraph (d) of this subsection;\
(7) The rationale for using other than-\
(i) A firm-fixed price order; or\
(ii) A performance-based order; and\
(8) When an order exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, evidence of compliance with the ordering procedures at\
\cf3 8.405-2\cf4 (c).\

\f0\b 8.405-3 Blanket purchase agreements (BPAs).\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Establishment
\f1\i0 . (1) Ordering activities may establish BPAs under any schedule contract to fill repetitive needs for supplies or services. Ordering activities shall establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that can provide the supply or service that represents the best value.\
(2) In addition to price (see \cf3 8.404\cf4 (d) and \cf3 8.405-4\cf4 ), when determining best value, the ordering activity may consider, among other factors, the following:\
(i) Past performance.\
(ii) Special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance. (iii) Trade-in considerations.\
(iv) Probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item.\
(v) Warranty considerations.\
(vi) Maintenance availability.\
(vii) Environmental and energy efficiency considerations.\
(viii) Delivery terms.\
(3) (i) The ordering activity contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, give preference to establishing multiple-award BPAs, rather than establishing a single-award BPA.\
(ii) No single-award BPA with an estimated value exceeding $100 million (including any options), may be awarded unless the head of the agency determines in writing that-\
(A) The orders expected under the BPA are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work;\
(B) The BPA provides only for firm-fixed priced orders for-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Products with unit prices established in the BPA; or\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Services with prices established in the BPA for specific tasks to be performed;\
(C) Only one source is qualified and capable of performing the work at a reasonable price to the Government; or\
(D) It is necessary in the public interest to award the BPA to a single source for exceptional circumstances. (iii) The requirement for a determination for a single-award BPA greater than $100 million is in addition to any\
applicable requirement for a limited-source justification at \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 . However, the two documents may be combined into one document.\
(iv) In determining how many multiple-award BPAs to establish or that a single-award BPA is appropriate, the contracting officer should consider the following factors and document the decision in the acquisition plan or BPA file:\
    prices;\
(A) The scope and complexity of the requirement(s);\
(B) The benefits of on-going competition and the need to periodically compare multiple technical approaches or\
(C) The administrative costs of BPAs; and\

(4) BPAs shall address the frequency of ordering, invoicing, discounts, requirements (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , estimated quantities, work to\
be performed), delivery locations, and time.\
(5) When establishing multiple-award BPAs, the ordering activity shall specify the procedures for placing orders under\
the BPAs in accordance with \cf3 8.405-3\cf4 (c)(2).\
(6) Establishment of a multi-agency BPA against a Federal Supply Schedule contract is permitted if the multi-agency\
BPA identifies the participating agencies and their estimated requirements at the time the BPA is established.\
(7) 
\f2\i Minimum documentation
\f1\i0 . The ordering activity contracting officer shall include in the BPA file documentation the-\
(i) Schedule contracts considered, noting the contractor to which the BPA was awarded; (ii) Description of the supply or service purchased;\
(iii) Price;\
(iv) Required justification for a limited-source BPA (see \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 ), if applicable;\

(vi) Documentation supporting the decision to establish multiple-award BPAs or a single-award BPA (see (a)(3)(iv)); (vii) Evidence of compliance with paragraph (b) of this section, for competitively awarded BPAs, if applicable; and (viii) 
\f2\i Basis for the award decision
\f1\i0 . This should include the evaluation methodology used in selecting the contractor,\
the rationale for any tradeoffs in making the selection, and a price reasonableness determination for services requiring a statement of work.\
(b) 
\f2\i Competitive procedures for establishing a BPA
\f1\i0 . This paragraph applies to the establishment of a BPA, in addition to applicable instructions in paragraph (a).\
(1) 
\f2\i For supplies, and for services not requiring a statement of work
\f1\i0 . The procedures of this paragraph apply when establishing a BPA for supplies and services that are listed in the schedule contract at a fixed price for the performance of a specific task, where a statement of work is not required (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , installation, maintenance, and repair).\
(i) 
\f2\i If the estimated value of the BPA does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. 
\f1\i0 (A) The ordering activity shall:\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Consider reasonably available information about the supply or service offered under MAS contracts\
by surveying at least three schedule contractors through the GSA Advantage! on-line shopping service, by reviewing the catalogs or pricelists of at least three schedule contractors, or by requesting quotations from at least three schedule contractors (see \cf3 8.405-5\cf4 ); or\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Document the circumstances for restricting consideration to fewer than three schedule contractors based on one of the reasons at \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 (a).\
(B) The ordering activity shall establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that can provide the best value. (ii) 
\f2\i If the estimated value of the BPA exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold
\f1\i0 . The ordering activity contracting\
officer:\
(A) Shall provide an RFQ that includes a description of the supplies to be delivered or the services to be performed and the basis upon which the selection will be made.\
(B) (
\f2\i 1
\f1\i0 ) Shall post the RFQ on \cf2 eBuy to afford all schedule contractors offering the required supplies or services under the appropriate multiple award schedule(s) an opportunity to submit a quote; or\
(
\f2\i 2
\f1\i0 ) Shall provide the RFQ to as many schedule contractors as practicable, consistent with market research appropriate to the circumstances, to reasonably ensure that quotes will be received from at least three contractors that can fulfill the requirements. When fewer than three quotes are received from schedule contractors that can fulfill the requirements, the contracting officer shall prepare a written determination explaining that no additional contractors capable of fulfilling the requirements could be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so. The determination must clearly explain efforts made to obtain quotes from at least three schedule contractors.\
(C) Shall ensure all quotes received are fairly considered and award is made in accordance with the basis for selection in the RFQ. After seeking price reductions (see \cf3 8.405-4\cf4 ), establish the BPA with the schedule contractor(s) that provides the best value.\
(D) The BPA must be established in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, unless the requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared and approved in accordance with \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 .\
(2) 
\f2\i For services requiring a statement of work
\f1\i0 . This applies when establishing a BPA that requires services priced at hourly rates, as provided by the schedule contract. The applicable services will be identified in the Federal Supply Schedule publications and the contractor\'92s pricelists.\

(3) After award, ordering activities should provide timely notification to unsuccessful offerors. If an unsuccessful offeror requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the award decision shall be provided.\
(c) 
\f2\i Ordering from BPAs
\f1\i0 . The procedures in this paragraph (c) are not required for BPAs established on or before May 16, 2011. However, ordering activities are encouraged to use the procedures for such BPAs.\
(1) 
\f2\i Single-award BPA
\f1\i0 . If the ordering activity establishes a single-award BPA, authorized users may place the order directly under the established BPA when the need for the supply or service arises.\
(2) 
\f2\i Multiple-award BPAs
\f1\i0 . (i) Orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold. The ordering activity may place orders at or below the micro-purchase threshold with any BPA holder that can meet the agency needs. The ordering activity should attempt to distribute any such orders among the BPA holders.\
(ii) Orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. (A)\
The ordering activity must provide each multiple-award BPA holder a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold unless one of the exceptions at \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 (a)(1)(i) applies.\
(B) The ordering activity need not contact each of the multiple-award BPA holders before placing an order if information is available to ensure that each BPA holder is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order.\

award decision.\
(3) 
\f2\i BPAs for hourly-rate services
\f1\i0 . If the BPA is for hourly-rate services, the ordering activity shall develop a statement\
of work for each order covered by the BPA. Ordering activities should place these orders on a firm-fixed price basis to the maximum extent practicable. For time-and-materials and labor-hour orders, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures at \cf3 8.404\cf4 (h). All orders under the BPA shall specify a price for the performance of the tasks identified in the statement of work. The ordering activity is responsible for considering the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform a specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable through appropriate analysis techniques, and documenting the file accordingly.\
(d) 
\f2\i Duration of BPAs
\f1\i0 . (1) Multiple-award BPAs generally should not exceed five years in length, but may do so to meet program requirements.\
(2) A single-award BPA shall not exceed one year. It may have up to four one-year options. See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements associated with option exercise.\
(3) Contractors may be awarded BPAs that extend beyond the current term of their GSA Schedule contract, so long as there are option periods in their GSA Schedule contract that, if exercised, will cover the BPA\'92s period of performance.\
(e) 
\f2\i Review of BPAs
\f1\i0 . (1) The ordering activity contracting officer shall review the BPA and determine in writing, at least once a year (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , at option exercise), whether-\
(i) The schedule contract, upon which the BPA was established, is still in effect;\
(ii) The BPA still represents the best value (see \cf3 8.404\cf4 (d)); and\
(iii) Estimated quantities/amounts have been exceeded and additional price reductions can be obtained.\
(2) The determination shall be included in the BPA file documentation.\

\f0\b 8.405-4 Price reductions.\

\f1\b0 Ordering activities may request a price reduction at any time before placing an order, establishing a BPA, or in conjunction with the annual BPA review. However, the ordering activity shall seek a price reduction when the order or BPA exceeds\
the simplified acquisition threshold. Schedule contractors are not required to pass on to all schedule users a price reduction extended only to an individual ordering activity for a specific order or BPA.\

\f0\b 8.405-5 Small business.\

\f1\b0 (a) Although the preference programs of part \cf3 19 \cf4 are not mandatory in this subpart, in accordance with section 1331 of Public Law 111-240 (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 644\cf4 (r))-\
(1) Ordering activity contracting officers may, at their discretion-\
(i) Set aside orders for any of the small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3); and (ii) Set aside BPAs for any of the small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3).\
(2) When setting aside orders and BPAs-\
(i) Follow the ordering procedures for Federal Supply Schedules at \cf3 8.405-1\cf4 , \cf3 8.405-2\cf4 , and \cf3 8.405-3\cf4 ; and (ii) The specific small business program eligibility requirements identified in part \cf3 19 \cf4 apply.\
(b) Orders placed under schedule contracts may be credited toward the ordering activity\'92s small business goals. For purposes of reporting an order placed with a small business schedule contractor, an ordering agency may only take credit if the awardee meets a size standard that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System code assigned to the order in accordance with \cf3 19.102\cf4 (b)(3). Ordering activities should rely on the small business representations made by schedule contractors at the contract level (but see section \cf3 19.301-2\cf4 (b)(2) concerning rerepresentation for an order).\
(c) Ordering activities may consider socio-economic status when identifying contractor(s) for consideration or competition for award of an order or BPA. At a minimum, ordering activities should consider, if available, at least one small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, women-owned\

(d) For orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, ordering activities should give preference to the items of small business concerns when two or more items at the same delivered price will satisfy the requirement.\

\f0\b 8.405-6 Limiting sources.\

\f1\b0 Orders placed or BPAs established under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements in \cf3 part 6\cf4 . However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section\'97\
(a) Orders or BPAs exceeding the micro-purchase threshold based on a limited sources justification.\
(1) Circumstances justifying limiting the source. (i) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the micro-purchase threshold not placed or established in accordance with the procedures in, \cf3 8.405-2\cf4 , or \cf3 8.405-3\cf4 , the only\
circumstances that may justify the action are\'96\
(A) An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays; (B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required\
because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; or\
(C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply\
Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures.\
(ii) See \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 (c) for the content of the justification for an order or BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(2) Posting. (i) Within 14 days after placing an order or establishing a BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that is supported by a limited-sources justification permitted under any of the circumstances under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the ordering activity shall\'96\
(A) Publish a notice in accordance with \cf3 5.301\cf4 ; and (B) Post the justification-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 At the GPE \cf3 https://www.sam.gov;\

\f2\i \cf4 (2) 
\f1\i0 On the Web site of the ordering activity agency, which may provide access to the justification by linking to\
the GPE; and\

\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 For a minimum of 30 days.\
(ii) In the case of an order or BPA permitted under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the justification shall be\
posted within 30 days after award.\
(iii) Contracting officers shall carefully screen all justifications for contractor proprietary data and remove\
all such data, and such references and citations as are necessary to protect the proprietary data, before making the justifications available for public inspection. Contracting officers shall also be guided by the exemptions to disclosure of information contained in the Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C. 552\cf4 ) and the prohibitions against disclosure in \cf3 24.202 \cf4 in determining whether other data should be removed. Although the submitter notice process set out in Executive Order 12600 "Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information" does not apply, if the justification appears to contain proprietary data, the contracting officer should provide the contractor that submitted the information an opportunity to review the justification for proprietary data before making the justification available for public inspection, redacted as necessary. This process must not prevent or delay the posting of the justification in accordance with the timeframes required in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.\
(iv) This posting requirement does not apply when disclosure would compromise the national security (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , would result in disclosure of classified information) or create other security risks.\
(b) 
\f2\i Items peculiar to one manufacturer
\f1\i0 . An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer. A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer.\
(1) Brand name specifications shall not be used unless the particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government\'92s requirements, and market research indicates other companies\'92 similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency\'92s needs.\

(ii) For proposed orders or BPAs with an estimated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, see paragraph (c) of this section.\
(iii) The documentation or justification must be completed and approved at the time the requirement for a brand- name item is determined. In addition, the justification for a brand-name item is required at the order level when a justification for the brand-name item was not completed for the BPA or does not adequately cover the requirements in the order.\
(3) 
\f2\i Posting
\f1\i0 . (i) The ordering activity shall post the following information along with the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to eBuy (\cf3 https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov\cf2 ):\
(A) For proposed orders or BPAs with an estimated value exceeding $25,000, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the documentation required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.\

(C) The documentation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this sectionand the justification in paragraph (c) of this section is subject to the screening requirement in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.\
(ii) The posting requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply when-\
(A) Disclosure would compromise the national security (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , would result in disclosure of classified information)\
or create other security risks. The fact that access to classified matter may be necessary to submit a proposal or perform the contract does not, in itself, justify use of this exception;\
(B) The nature of the file (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , size, format) does not make it cost-effective or practicable for contracting officers to provide access through eBuy;; or\
(C) The agency\'92s senior procurement executive makes a written determination that access through eBuy is not in the Government\'92s interest.\
(4) When applicable, the documentation and posting requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section apply only to the portion of the order or BPA that requires a brand-name item. If the justification and approval is to cover only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name, then it should so state; the approval level requirements will then only apply to that portion.\
(c) An order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. (1) For a proposed order or BPA exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the requiring activity shall assist the ordering activity contracting officer in the preparation of the justification. The justification shall cite that the acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (see \cf3 8.401\cf4 ).\
(2) At a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:\
(i) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a\
"Limited-Sources Justification."\
(ii) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.\
(iii) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency\'92s needs (including the estimated value). (iv) The authority and supporting rationale (see \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 (a)(1)(i) and (b)(1)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the\
proposed contractor\'92s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.\
(v) A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent\
with \cf3 8.404\cf4 (d).\
(vi) A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the\
reason market research was not conducted.\
(vii) Any other facts supporting the justification.\
(viii) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the\
restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.\
(ix) The ordering activity contracting officer\'92s certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best\
of the contracting officer\'92s knowledge and belief.\
(x) Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , verifying\
the Government\'92s minimum needs or requirements or other rationale for limited sources) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.\
(xi) For justifications under \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 (a)(1), a written determination by the approving official identifying the circumstance that applies.\

(2) Services:\
(i) AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies.\

\f0\b 8.705 Procedures.\
8.705-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Ordering offices shall obtain supplies and services on the Procurement List from the central nonprofit agency or its designated AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies, except that supplies identified on the Procurement List as available from DLA, GSA, or VA supply distribution facilities shall be obtained through DLA, GSA, or VA procedures. If a distribution facility cannot provide the supplies, it shall inform the ordering office, which shall then order from the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency designated by the Committee.\
(b) Supply distribution facilities in DLA and GSA shall obtain supplies on the Procurement List from the central nonprofit agency identified or its designated AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency.\

\f0\b 8.705-2 Direct-order process.\

\f1\b0 Central nonprofit agencies may authorize ordering offices to transmit orders for specific supplies or services directly to an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency. The written authorization remains valid until it is revoked by the central nonprofit agency or the Committee. The central nonprofit agency shall specify the normal delivery or performance lead time required by the nonprofit agency. The ordering office shall reflect this lead time in its orders.\

\f0\b 8.705-3 Allocation process.\

\f1\b0 (a) When the direct order process has not been authorized, the ordering office shall submit a written request for allocation (requesting the designation of the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency to produce the supplies or perform the service) to the central nonprofit agency designated in the Procurement List. Ordering offices shall request allocations in sufficient time for a reply, for orders to be placed, and for the nonprofit agency to produce the supplies or provide the service within the required delivery or performance schedule.\
(b) The ordering office\'92s request to the central nonprofit agency for allocation shall include the following information: (1) For supplies-Item name, stock number, latest specification, quantity, unit price, date delivery is required, and\
destination to which delivery is to be made.\
(2) For services-Type and location of service required, latest specification, work to be performed, estimated volume,\
and required date or dates for completion.\
(3) Other requirements; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 packing, marking, as necessary.\
(c) When an allocation is received, the ordering office shall promptly issue an order to the specified AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency or to the central nonprofit agency, as instructed by the allocation. If the issuance of an order is to be delayed for more than 15 days beyond receipt of the allocation, or canceled, the ordering office shall advise the central nonprofit agency immediately.\
(d) Ordering offices may issue orders without limitation as to dollar amount and shall record them upon issuance as obligations. Each order shall include, as a minimum, the information contained in the request for allocation. Ordering offices\

\f1\b0 (a) The central nonprofit agency shall inform the ordering office of changes in lead time experienced by its AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies to minimize requests for extensions once the ordering office places an order.\
(b) The ordering office shall grant a request by a central nonprofit agency or AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency for revision in the delivery or completion schedule, if feasible. If extension of the delivery or completion date is not feasible, the ordering office shall notify the appropriate central nonprofit agency and request that it reallocate the order, or grant a purchase exception authorizing acquisition from commercial sources.\
(c) When an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency fails to perform under the terms of an order, the ordering office shall make every effort to resolve the noncompliance with the nonprofit agency involved and to negotiate an adjustment before taking action to cancel the order. If the problem cannot be resolved with the nonprofit agency, the ordering office shall refer the matter for resolution first to the central nonprofit agency and then, if necessary, to the Committee.\
(d) When, after complying with \cf3 8.705-4\cf4 (c), the ordering office determines that it must cancel an order, it shall notify the central nonprofit agency and, if practical, request a reallocation of the order. When the central nonprofit agency cannot reallocate the order, it shall grant a purchase exception permitting use of commercial sources, subject to approval by the Committee when the value of the purchase exception is $25,000 or more.\

covered by the exception.\

(2) Provide a copy of the solicitation to the central nonprofit agency when it is issued.\
(e) The Committee may also grant a purchase exception, under any circumstances it considers appropriate.\

\f1\b0 (a) The prices of items on the Procurement List are fair market prices established by the Committee. All prices for supplies ordered under this subpart are f.o.b. origin.\
(b) Prices for supplies are normally adjusted semiannually. Prices for services are normally adjusted annually.\
(c) The Committee may request the agency responsible for acquiring the supplies or service to assist it in establishing or revising the fair market price. The Committee has the authority to establish prices without prior coordination with the responsible contracting office.\
(d) Price changes shall normally apply to all orders received by the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency on or after the effective date of the change. In special cases, after considering the views of the ordering office, the Committee may make price changes applicable to orders received by the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency prior to the effective date of the change.\
(e) If an ordering office desires packing, packaging, or marking of supplies other than the standard pack as provided on the Procurement List, any difference in costs shall be included as a separate item on the nonprofit agency\'92s invoice. The ordering office shall reimburse the nonprofit agency for these costs.\

 9.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies, standards, and procedures pertaining to prospective contractors\'92 responsibility; debarment, suspension, and ineligibility; qualified products; first article testing and approval; contractor team arrangements; defense production pools and research and development pools; and organizational conflicts of interest.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 9.1 - Responsible Prospective Contractors\

\fs20 9.100 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies, standards, and procedures for determining whether prospective contractors and subcontractors are responsible.\

\f0\b 9.101 Definitions.\

\f2\i\b0 Administrative proceeding 
\f1\i0 means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and state level but only in connections with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.\

\f2\i Surveying activity
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means the cognizant contract administration office or, if there is no such office, another organization designated by the agency to conduct preaward surveys.\

\f0\b 9.102 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart applies to all proposed contracts with any prospective contractor that is located-\
(1) In the United States or its outlying areas; or\
(2) Elsewhere, unless application of the subpart would be inconsistent with the laws or customs where the contractor is\
located.\
(b) This subpart does not apply to proposed contracts with-\
(1) Foreign, State, or local governments;\
(2) Other U.S. Government agencies or their instrumentalities; or\
(3) Agencies for people who are blind or severely disabled (see \cf3 subpart 8.7\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 9.103 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Purchases shall be made from, and contracts shall be awarded to, responsible prospective contractors only.\
(b) No purchase or award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an affirmative determination of responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective contractor is responsible, the contracting officer shall make a determination of nonresponsibility. If the prospective contractor is a small business concern, the contracting officer shall comply with \cf3 subpart 19.6\cf4 , Certificates of Competency and Determinations of Responsibility. (If Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C.637\cf4 ) applies, see \cf3 subpart 19.8\cf4 .)\
(c) The award of a contract to a supplier based on lowest evaluated price alone can be false economy if there is subsequent default, late deliveries, or other unsatisfactory performance resulting in additional contractual or administrative costs. While it is important that Government purchases be made at the lowest price, this does not require an award to a supplier solely because that supplier submits the lowest offer. A prospective contractor must affirmatively demonstrate its responsibility, including, when necessary, the responsibility of its proposed subcontractors.\

\f0\b 9.104 Standards.\
9.104-1 General standards.\

\f1\b0 To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must-\
(a) Have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them (see \cf3 9.104-3\cf4 (a));\
(b) Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all\
existing commercial and governmental business commitments;\
(c) Have a satisfactory performance record (see \cf3 9.104-3 \cf4 (b) and \cf3 subpart 42.15\cf4 ). A prospective contractor shall not be\
determined responsible or nonresponsible solely on the basis of a lack of relevant performance history, except as provided in \cf3 9.104-2\cf4 ;\

\f1\b0 F
\fs16 EDERAL 
\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (d) Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics (for example, see \cf3 subpart 42.15\cf4 );\
(e) Have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them (including, as appropriate, such elements as production control procedures, property control systems, quality assurance measures, and safety programs applicable to materials to be produced or services to be performed by the prospective contractor and subcontractors). (See \cf3 9.104-3\cf4 (a).)\
(f) Have the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them (see \cf3 9.104-3\cf4 (a)); and\
(g) Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations (see also inverted domestic corporation prohibition at \cf3 9.108\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 9.104-2 Special standards.\

\f1\b0 (a) When it is necessary for a particular acquisition or class of acquisitions, the contracting officer shall develop, with the assistance of appropriate specialists, special standards of responsibility. Special standards may be particularly desirable when experience has demonstrated that unusual expertise or specialized facilities are needed for adequate contract performance. The special standards shall be set forth in the solicitation (and so identified) and shall apply to all offerors.\
(b) Contracting officers shall award contracts for subsistence only to those prospective contractors that meet the general standards in \cf3 9.104-1 \cf4 and are approved in accordance with agency sanitation standards and procedures.\

\f0\b 9.104-3 Application of standards.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Ability to obtain resources
\f1\i0 . Except to the extent that a prospective contractor has sufficient resources or proposes\
to perform the contract by subcontracting, the contracting officer shall require acceptable evidence of the prospective contractor\'92s ability to obtain required resources (see \cf3 9.104-1\cf4 (a), (e), and (f)). Acceptable evidence normally consists of a commitment or explicit arrangement, that will be in existence at the time of contract award, to rent, purchase, or otherwise acquire the needed facilities, equipment, other resources, or personnel. Consideration of a prime contractor\'92s compliance with limitations on subcontracting shall take into account the time period covered by the contract base period or quantities plus option periods or quantities, if such options are considered when evaluating offers for award.\
(b) 
\f2\i Satisfactory performance record
\f1\i0 . A prospective contractor that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed to be nonresponsible, unless the contracting officer determines that the circumstances\
were properly beyond the contractor\'92s control, or that the contractor has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of nonresponsibility. Failure to meet\
the quality requirements of the contract is a significant factor to consider in determining satisfactory performance. The contracting officer shall consider the number of contracts involved and the extent of deficient performance in each contract when making this determination. If the pending contract requires a subcontracting plan pursuant to \cf3 subpart 19.7\cf4 , The Small Business Subcontracting Program, the contracting officer shall also consider the prospective contractor\'92s compliance with subcontracting plans under recent contracts.\
(c) (1) 
\f2\i Affiliated concerns
\f1\i0 . Affiliated concerns (see "Concern" in \cf3 19.001 \cf4 and "Small business concern" in \cf3 2.101 \cf4 ) are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the contracting officer shall consider the affiliate\'92s past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the prospective contractor\'92s responsibility.\
(2) 
\f2\i Joint ventures. 
\f1\i0 For a prospective contractor that is a joint venture, the contracting officer shall consider the past performance of the joint venture. If the joint venture does not demonstrate past performance for award, the contracting officer shall consider the past performance of each party to the joint venture.\
(d) (1) 
\f2\i Small business concerns
\f1\i0 . Upon making a determination of nonresponsibility with regard to a small business concern, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration, which will decide whether to issue a Certificate of Competency (see subpart \cf3 19.6\cf4 ).\
(2) 
\f2\i Limitations on subcontracting
\f1\i0 . A small business that is unable to comply with the limitations on subcontracting may be considered nonresponsible (see \cf3 52.219-3\cf4 , Notice of HUBZone Set-Aside or Sole Source Award; \cf3 52.219-4\cf4 , Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns; \cf3 52.219-14\cf4 , Limitations on Subcontracting; \cf3 52.219-27\cf4 ,Notice of Set-Aside for, or Sole-Source Award to, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Concerns Eligible Under the SDVOSB Program; \cf3 52.219-29\cf4 , Notice of Set-Aside for, or Sole-Source Award to, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business Concerns; and \cf3 52.219-30\cf4 , Notice of Set-Aside for, or Sole Source Award to, Women-Owned Small Business Concerns Eligible Under the Women-Owned Small Business Program). A small business that has not agreed to comply with the limitations on subcontracting may be considered nonresponsive.\

 9.104-4 Subcontractor responsibility.\

\f1\b0 (a) Generally, prospective prime contractors are responsible for determining the responsibility of their prospective subcontractors (but see \cf3 9.405 \cf4 and \cf3 9.405-2 \cf4 regarding debarred, ineligible, or suspended firms). Determinations of prospective subcontractor responsibility may affect the Government's determination of the prospective prime contractor's responsibility. A prospective contractor may be required to provide written evidence of a proposed subcontractor's responsibility.\
(b) When it is in the Government\'92s interest to do so, the contracting officer may directly determine a prospective subcontractor\'92s responsibility (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 when the prospective contract involves medical supplies, urgent requirements, or substantial subcontracting). In this case, the same standards used to determine a prime contractor\'92s responsibility shall be used by the Government to determine subcontractor responsibility.\

\f0\b 9.104-5 Representation and certifications regarding responsibility matters.\

\f1\b0 (a) When an offeror provides an affirmative response in paragraph (a)(1) of the provision at \cf3 52.209-5\cf4 , Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters, or paragraph (h) of provision \cf3 52.212-3\cf4 , the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Promptly, upon receipt of offers, request such additional information from the offeror as the offeror deems necessary in order to demonstrate the offeror\'92s responsibility to the contracting officer (but see \cf3 9.405\cf4 ); and\
(2) Notify, prior to proceeding with award, in accordance with agency procedures (see \cf3 9.406-3\cf4 (a) and \cf3 9.407-3\cf4 (a)), the agency official responsible for initiating debarment or suspension action, where an offeror indicates the existence of an indictment, charge, conviction, or civil judgment, or Federal tax delinquency in an amount that exceeds $10,000.\
(b) The provision at \cf3 52.209-11\cf4 , Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law, implements sections 744 and 745 of Division E of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) (and similar provisions in subsequent appropriations acts). When an offeror provides an affirmative response in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of the provision at \cf3 52.209-11 \cf4 or paragraph (q)(2)(i) or (ii) of provision \cf3 52.212-3\cf4 , the contracting officer shall\'96\
(1) Promptly, upon receipt of offers, request such additional information from the offeror as the offeror deems necessary in order to demonstrate the offeror's responsibility to the contracting officer (but see \cf3 9.405\cf4 );\
(2) Notify, in accordance with agency procedures (see \cf3 9.406-3\cf4 (a) and \cf3 9.407-3\cf4 (a)), the agency official responsible for initiating debarment or suspension action; and\
(3) Not award to the corporation unless an agency suspending or debarring official has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that suspension or debarment is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.\
(c) If the provision at \cf3 52.209-12\cf4 , Certification Regarding Tax Matters, is applicable (see \cf3 9.104-7\cf4 (e)), then the contracting officer shall not award any contract in an amount greater than $5.5 million, unless the offeror affirmatively certified in its offer, as required by paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of the provision.\
(d) Offerors who do not furnish the representation or certifications or such information as may be requested by the contracting officer shall be given an opportunity to remedy the deficiency. Failure to furnish the representation or certifications or such information may render the offeror nonresponsible.\

\f0\b 9.104-6 Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Before awarding a contract in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer shall review the performance and integrity information available in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), (available at \cf3 https://www.cpars.gov\cf4 ), including FAPIIS information from the System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions and the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).\
(2) In accordance with \cf3 41 U.S.C. 2313(d)(3)\cf4 , FAPIIS also identifies\'96\
(i) An affiliate that is an immediate owner or subsidiary of the offeror, if any (see \cf3 52.204-17\cf4 , Ownership or Control\
of Offeror); and\
(ii) All predecessors of the offeror that held a Federal contract or grant within the last three years (see \cf3 52.204-20\cf4 ,\
Predecessor of Offeror).\
(b) (1) When making a responsibility determination, the contracting officer shall consider all the information available\
through FAPIIS with regard to the offeror and any immediate owner, predecessor, or subsidiary identified for that offeror in FAPIIS, as well as other past performance information on the offeror (see \cf3 subpart 42.15\cf4 ).\
(2) For evaluation of information available through FAPIIS relating to an affiliate of the offeror, see \cf3 9.104-3\cf4 (c).\

\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (3) For source selection evaluations of past performance, see \cf3 15.305\cf4 (a)(2). Contracting officers shall use sound judgment in determining the weight and relevance of the information contained in FAPIIS and how it relates to the present acquisition.\
(4) Since FAPIIS may contain information on any of the offeror's previous contracts and information covering a five-year period, some of that information may not be relevant to a determination of present responsibility, e.g., a prior administrative action such as debarment or suspension that has expired or otherwise been resolved, or information relating to contracts for completely different products or services..\
(5) Because FAPIIS is a database that provides information about prime contractors, the contracting officer posts information required to be posted about a subcontractor, such as trafficking in persons violations, to the record of the prime contractor (see \cf3 42.1503\cf4 (h)(1)(v)). The prime contractor has the opportunity to post in FAPIIS any mitigating factors. The contracting officer shall consider any mitigating factors posted in FAPIIS by the prime contractor, such as degree of compliance by the prime contractor with the terms of FAR clause \cf3 52.222-50\cf4 .\
(c) If the contracting officer obtains relevant information from FAPIIS regarding criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Government contract; terminations for default or cause; determinations of nonresponsibility because the contractor does not have a satisfactory performance record or a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; or comparable information relating to a grant, the contracting officer shall, unless the contractor has already been debarred or suspended-\
(1) Promptly request such additional information from the offeror as the offeror deems necessary in order to demonstrate the offeror\'92s responsibility to the contracting officer (but see \cf3 9.405\cf4 ); and\
(2) Notify, prior to proceeding with award, in accordance with agency procedures (see \cf3 9.406-3\cf4 (a) and \cf3 9.407-3\cf4 (a)), the agency official responsible for initiating debarment or suspension action, if the information appears appropriate for the official\'92s consideration.\
(d) The contracting officer shall document the contract file for each contract in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold to indicate how the information in FAPIIS was considered in any responsibility determination, as well as the action that was taken as a result of the information. A contracting officer who makes a nonresponsibility determination is required to document that information in FAPIIS in accordance with \cf3 9.105-2\cf4 (b)(2).\

\f0\b 9.104-7 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.209-5\cf4 , Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters, in solicitations where the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.209-7\cf4 , Information Regarding Responsibility Matters, in solicitations where the resultant contract value is expected to exceed $600,000.\
(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.209-9\cf4 , Updates of Publicly Available Information Regarding Responsibility Matters-\
(1) In solicitations where the resultant contract value is expected to exceed $600,000; and\
(2) In contracts in which the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of the provision at \cf3 52.209-7\cf4 .\
(d) The contracting officer shall insert the provision \cf3 52.209-11\cf4 , Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax\
Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law, in all solicitations.\
(e) For agencies receiving funds subject to section 523 of Division B of the Consolidated and Further Continuing\
Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and similar provisions in subsequent appropriations acts, the contracting\
officer shall insert the provision \cf3 52.209-12\cf4 , Certification Regarding Tax Matters, in solicitations for which the resultant contract (including options) may have a value greater than $5.5 million. Division B of the Consolidated and Continuing Further Appropriations Act, 2015 appropriates funds for the following agencies: the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation, the Commission on Civil Rights, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. International Trade Commission, the Legal Services Corporation, the Marine Mammal Commission, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and the State Justice Institute.\

\f0\b 9.105 Procedures.\
9.105-1 Obtaining information.\

\f1\b0 (a) Before making a determination of responsibility, the contracting officer shall possess or obtain information sufficient to be satisfied that a prospective contractor currently meets the applicable standards in \cf3 9.104\cf4 .\

\f1\b0 (b) (1) Generally, the contracting officer shall obtain information regarding the responsibility of prospective contractors, including requesting preaward surveys when necessary (see \cf3 9.106\cf4 ), promptly after a bid opening or receipt of offers. However, in negotiated contracting, especially when research and development is involved, the contracting officer may obtain this information before issuing the request for proposals. Requests for information shall ordinarily be limited to information concerning-\
(i) The low bidder; or\
(ii) Those offerors in range for award.\
(2) Preaward surveys shall be managed and conducted by the surveying activity.\
(i) If the surveying activity is a contract administration office-\
(A) That office shall advise the contracting officer on prospective contractors\'92 financial competence and credit\
needs; and\
(B) The administrative contracting officer shall obtain from the auditor any information required concerning the\
adequacy of prospective contractors\'92 accounting systems and these systems\'92 suitability for use in administering the proposed type of contract.\
(ii) If the surveying activity is not a contract administration office, the contracting officer shall obtain from the auditor any information required concerning prospective contractors\'92 financial competence and credit needs, the adequacy of their accounting systems, and these systems\'92 suitability for use in administering the proposed type of contract.\
(3) Information on financial resources and performance capability shall be obtained or updated on as current a basis as is feasible up to the date of award.\
(c) In making the determination of responsibility, the contracting officer shall consider information available through FAPIIS (see \cf3 9.104-6\cf4 ) with regard to the offeror and any immediate owner, predecessor, or subsidiary identified for that offeror in FAPIIS, including information that is linked to FAPIIS such as from SAM, and CPARS, as well as any other relevant past performance information on the offeror (see \cf3 9.104-1\cf4 (c) and \cf3 subpart 42.15\cf4 ). In addition, the contracting officer should use the following sources of information to support such determinations:\
(1) Records and experience data, including verifiable knowledge of personnel within the contracting office, audit offices, contract administration offices, and other contracting offices.\
(2) The prospective contractor-including bid or proposal information (including the certification at \cf3 52.209-5 \cf4 or \cf3 52.212-3\cf4 (h) (see \cf3 9.104-5\cf4 )), questionnaire replies, financial data, information on production equipment, and personnel information.\
(3) Commercial sources of supplier information of a type offered to buyers in the private sector.\
(4) Preaward survey reports (see \cf3 9.106\cf4 ).\
(5) Other sources such as publications; suppliers, subcontractors, and customers of the prospective contractor; financial\
institutions; Government agencies; and business and trade associations.\
(d) Contracting offices and cognizant contract administration offices that become aware of circumstances casting doubt on\
a contractor\'92s ability to perform contracts successfully shall promptly exchange relevant information.\

\f0\b 9.105-2 Determinations and documentation.\

\f1\b0 (a) Determinations. (1) The contracting officer\'92s signing of a contract constitutes a determination that the prospective contractor is responsible with respect to that contract. When an offer on which an award would otherwise be made is rejected because the prospective contractor is found to be nonresponsible, the contracting officer shall make, sign, and place in the contract file a determination of nonresponsibility, which shall state the basis for the determination.\
(2) If the contracting officer determines that a responsive small business lacks certain elements of responsibility, the contracting officer shall comply with the procedures in \cf3 subpart 19.6\cf4 . When a Certificate of Competency is issued for a small business concern (see \cf3 subpart 19.6\cf4 ), the contracting officer shall accept the Small Business Administration\'92s decision to issue a Certificate of Competency and award the contract to the concern.\
(b) 
\f2\i Support documentation
\f1\i0 . (1) Documents and reports supporting a determination of responsibility or nonresponsibility, including any preaward survey reports, the use of FAPIIS information (see \cf3 9.104-6\cf4 ), and any applicable Certificate of Competency, must be included in the contract file.\
(2) (i) The contracting officer shall document the determination of nonresponsibility in FAPIIS (available at \cf3 https:// www.cpars.gov\cf4 ) if-\
(A) The contract is valued at more than the simplified acquisition threshold;\
(B) The determination of nonresponsibility is based on lack of satisfactory performance record or satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and\

\fs20 (C) The Small Business Administration does not issue a Certificate of Competency.\
(ii) The contracting officer is responsible for the timely submission, within 3 working days, and sufficiency, and\
accuracy of the documentation regarding the nonresponsibility determination.\
(iii) As required by section 3010 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-212), all information\
posted in FAPIIS on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews, will be publicly available. FAPIIS consists of two segments-\
(A) The non-public segment, into which Government officials and contractors post information, which can only be viewed by-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Government personnel and authorized users performing business on behalf of the Government; or\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 An offeror or contractor, when viewing data on itself; and\
(B) The publicly-available segment, to which all data in the non-public segment of FAPIIS is automatically\
transferred after a waiting period of 14 calendar days, except for-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Past performance reviews required by subpart \cf3 42.15\cf4 ;\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Information that was entered prior to April 15,2011; or\

\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 Information that is withdrawn during the 14-calendar-day waiting period by the Government official who posted it in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.\
(iv) The contracting officer, or any other Government official, shall not post any information in the non-public segment of FAPIIS that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the contractor asserts within 7 calendar days, to the Government official who posted the information, that some of the information posted to the non-public segment of FAPIIS is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Government official who posted the information must within 7 calendar days remove the posting from FAPIIS and resolve the issue in accordance with agency Freedom of Information Act procedures, prior to reposting the releasable information.\

\f0\b 9.105-3 Disclosure of preaward information.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in \cf3 subpart 24.2\cf4 , Freedom of Information Act, information (including the preaward survey report) accumulated for purposes of determining the responsibility of a prospective contractor shall not be released or disclosed outside the Government.\
(b) The contracting officer may discuss preaward survey information with the prospective contractor before determining responsibility. After award, the contracting officer or, if it is appropriate, the head of the surveying activity or a designee may discuss the findings of the preaward survey with the company surveyed.\
(c) Preaward survey information may contain proprietary or source selection information and should be marked with the appropriate legend and protected accordingly (see \cf3 3.104-4\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 9.106 Preaward surveys.\
9.106-1 Conditions for preaward surveys.\

\f1\b0 (a) A preaward survey is normally required only when the information on hand or readily available to the contracting officer, including information from commercial sources, is not sufficient to make a determination regarding responsibility. In addition, if the contemplated contract will have a fixed price at or below the simplified acquisition threshold or will involve the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services (see \cf3 part 12\cf4 ), the contracting officer should not request a preaward survey unless circumstances justify its cost.\
(b) When a cognizant contract administration office becomes aware of a prospective award to a contractor about which unfavorable information exists and no preaward survey has been requested, it shall promptly obtain and transmit details to the contracting officer.\
(c) Before beginning a preaward survey, the surveying activity shall ascertain whether the prospective contractor is debarred, suspended, or ineligible (see \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 ). If the prospective contractor is debarred, suspended, or ineligible, the surveying activity shall advise the contracting officer promptly and not proceed with the preaward survey unless specifically requested to do so by the contracting officer.\

\f0\b 9.106-2 Requests for preaward surveys.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer\'92s request to the surveying activity (Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor (General),\cf3 SF 1403\cf4 ) shall-\

\f0\b 9.106-3 Interagency preaward surveys.\

\f1\b0 When the contracting office and the surveying activity are in different agencies, the procedures of this section \cf3 9.106 \cf4 and \cf3 subpart 42.1 \cf4 shall be followed along with the regulations of the agency in which the surveying activity is located, except that reasonable special requests by the contracting office shall be accommodated (also see subpart \cf3 17.5\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 9.106-4 Reports.\

\f1\b0 (a) The surveying activity shall complete the applicable parts of \cf3 SF 1403\cf4 , Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor (General); \cf3 SF 1404\cf4 , Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor-Technical; \cf3 SF 1405\cf4 , Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor-Production; \cf3 SF 1406\cf4 , Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor-Quality Assurance; \cf3 SF 1407\cf4 , Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor-Financial Capability; and \cf3 SF 1408\cf4 , Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor-Accounting System; and provide a narrative discussion sufficient to support both the evaluation ratings and the recommendations.\
(b) When the contractor surveyed is a small business that has received preferential treatment on an ongoing contract under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 637\cf4 ) or has received a Certificate of Competency during the last 12 months, the surveying activity shall consult the appropriate Small Business Administration field office before making an affirmative recommendation regarding the contractor\'92s responsibility or nonresponsibility.\
(c) When a preaward survey discloses previous unsatisfactory performance, the surveying activity shall specify the extent to which the prospective contractor plans, or has taken, corrective action. Lack of evidence that past failure to meet contractual requirements was the prospective contractor\'92s fault does not necessarily indicate satisfactory performance. The narrative shall report any persistent pattern of need for costly and burdensome Government assistance (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 engineering, inspection, or testing) provided in the Government\'92s interest but not contractually required.\
(d) When the surveying activity possesses information that supports a recommendation of complete award without\
an on-site survey and no special areas for investigation have been requested, the surveying activity may provide a short- form preaward survey report. The short-form report shall consist solely of the Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor (General), \cf3 SF 1403\cf4 . Sections III and IV of this form shall be completed and block21 shall be checked to show that the report is a short-form preaward report.\

\f0\b 9.107 Surveys of nonprofit agencies participating in the AbilityOne Program.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), as authorized by\
\cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 85\cf4 , determines what supplies and services Federal agencies are required to purchase from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies serving people who are blind or have other severe disabilities (see \cf3 subpart 8.7\cf4 ). The Committee is required to find an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency capable of furnishing the supplies or services before the nonprofit agency can be designated as a mandatory source under the AbilityOne Program. The Committee may request a contracting office to assist in assessing the capabilities of a nonprofit agency.\
(b) The contracting office, upon request from the Committee, shall request a capability survey from the activity responsible for performing preaward surveys, or notify the Committee that the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency\
is capable, with supporting rationale, and that the survey is waived. The capability survey will focus on the technical and production capabilities and applicable preaward survey elements to furnish specific supplies or services being considered for addition to the Procurement List.\
(c) The contracting office shall use the \cf3 Standard Form 1403 \cf4 to request a capability survey of organizations employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities.\
(d) The contracting office shall furnish a copy of the completed survey, or notice that the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency is capable and the survey is waived, to the Executive Director, Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart implements \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3243 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3311 \cf4 and prescribes policies and procedures regarding qualification requirements and the acquisitions that are subject to such requirements.\

\f0\b 9.201 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Qualified bidders list (QBL) 
\f1\i0 means a list of bidders who have had their products examined and tested and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements for that product or have otherwise satisfied all applicable qualification requirements.\

\f2\i Qualified manufacturers list (QML) 
\f1\i0 means a list of manufacturers who have had their products examined and tested and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements for that product.\

\f0\b 9.202 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The head of the agency or designee shall, before establishing a qualification requirement, prepare a written justification-\
(i) Stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specifying why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;\
(ii) Estimating the likely costs for testing and evaluation which will be incurred by the potential offeror to become qualified; and\
(iii) Specifying all requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified. Only those requirements which are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirements shall be specified.\
(2) Upon request to the contracting activity, potential offerors shall be provided-\
(i) All requirements that they or their products must satisfy to become qualified; and\
(ii) At their expense (but see \cf3 9.204\cf4 (a)(2) with regard to small businesses), a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their\
abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned, or of another agency obtained through interagency agreements or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency).\
(3) If the services in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section are provided by contract, the contractors selected to provide testing and evaluation services shall be-\
(i) Those that are not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources; and\
(ii) Required by their contracts to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification.\
(4) A potential offeror seeking qualification shall be promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event it is not, promptly furnished specific reasons why qualification was not attained.\
(b) When justified under the circumstances, the agency activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement shall submit to the advocate for competition for the procuring activity responsible for purchasing the item subject to\
the qualification requirement, a determination that it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror (or its product) must satisfy. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) through (a)(4) of this section for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement. A copy of the waiver shall be furnished to the head of the agency or other official responsible for actions under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to qualification requirements contained in a QPL, QML, or QBL.\
(c) If a potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror (or its product) meets the standards established for qualification or can meet them before the date specified for award of the contract, a potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror-\
(1) Is not on a QPL, QML, or QBL maintained by the Department of Defense (DoD) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); or\

\fs20 (2) Has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19,1984, by DoD or NASA; or\
(3) Has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established by a civilian agency (not including NASA).\
(d) The procedures in \cf3 subpart 19.6 \cf4 for referring matters to the Small Business Administration are not mandatory on the contracting officer when the basis for a referral would involve a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror\'92s compliance with such requirement.\
(e) The contracting officer need not delay a proposed award in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification. In addition, when approved by the head of an agency or designee, a procurement need not be delayed in order to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.\
(f) Within 7 years following enforcement of a QPL, QML, or QBL by DoD or NASA, or within 7 years after any qualification requirement was originally established by a civilian agency other than NASA, the qualification requirement shall be examined and revalidated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. For DoD and NASA, qualification requirements other than QPL\'92s, QML\'92s and QBL\'92s shall be examined and revalidated within 7 years after establishment of the requirement under paragraph (a) of this section. Any periods for which a waiver under paragraph (b) of this section is in effect shall be excluded in computing the 7 years within which review and revalidation must occur.\

\f0\b 9.203 QPL\'92s, QML\'92s, and QBL\'92s.\

\f1\b0 (a) Qualification and listing in a QPL, QML, or QBL is the process by which products are obtained from manufacturers\
or distributors, examined and tested for compliance with specification requirements, or manufacturers or potential offerors, are provided an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. The names\
of successful products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included on lists evidencing their status. Generally, qualification is performed in advance and independently of any specific acquisition action. After qualification, the products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included in a Federal or Military QPL, QML, or QBL. (See \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a)(2) with regard to any product, manufacturer, or potential offeror not yet included on an applicable list.)\
(b) Specifications requiring a qualified product are included-\
(1) In the GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions; and\
(2) On the Department of Defense Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST) website\
at 
\f2\i \cf3 https://assist.dla.mil\cf4 .\

\f1\i0 (c) Instructions concerning qualification procedures are included in the following publications:\
(1) Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001.\
(2) Department of Defense Manual 4120.24, Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Procedures, ( 
\f2\i \cf3 www.esd.whs.mil/ Directives/Issuances/dodm 
\f1\i0 \cf4 ) as amended by Military Standards 961 and 962 (

(d) The publications in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section may be obtained from the address in \cf3 11.201\cf4 (d)(1).\

\f0\b 9.204 Responsibilities for establishment of a qualification requirement.\

\f1\b0 The responsibilities of agency activities that establish qualification requirements include the following:\
(a) Arranging publicity for the qualification requirements. If active competition on anticipated future qualification requirements is likely to be fewer than two manufacturers or the products of two manufacturers, the activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirements must-\
(1) Periodically furnish through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) a notice seeking additional sources or products for qualification unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise the national security.\
(2) Bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement. However, such costs may be borne only if it is determined in accordance with agency procedures that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within\
a reasonable period of time, considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements. A prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs must certify as to its status as a small business concern under Section 3 of the Small Business Act in order to receive further consideration.\

(d) Furnishing QPL\'92s, QML\'92s, or QBL\'92s or the qualification requirements themselves to prospective offerors and the public upon request (see \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a)(2)(i)).\
(e) Clarifying, as necessary, qualification requirements.\
(f) In appropriate cases, when requested by the contracting officer, providing concurrence in a decision not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation.\
(g) Withdrawing or omitting qualification of a listed product, manufacturer or offeror, as necessary.\
(h) Advising persons furnished any list of products, manufacturers or offerors meeting a qualification requirement and suppliers whose products are on any such list that-\
(1) The list does not constitute endorsement of the product, manufacturer, or other source by the Government;\
(2) The products or sources listed have been qualified under the latest applicable specification;\
(3) The list may be amended without notice;\
(4) The listing of a product or source does not release the supplier from compliance with the specification; and\
(5) Use of the list for advertising or publicity is permitted. However, it must not be stated or implied that a particular\
product or source is the only product or source of that type qualified, or that the Government in any way recommends or endorses the products or the sources listed.\
(i) Reexamining a qualified product or manufacturer when-\
(1) The manufacturer has modified its product, or changed the material or the processing sufficiently so that the validity\
of previous qualification is questionable;\
(2) The requirements in the specification have been amended or revised sufficiently to affect the character of the\
product; or\
(3) It is otherwise necessary to determine that the quality of the product is maintained in conformance with the\
specification.\

\f0\b 9.205 Opportunity for qualification before award.\

\f1\b0 (a) If an agency determines that a qualification requirement is necessary, the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement must urge manufacturers and other potential sources to demonstrate their ability to meet the standards specified for qualification and, when possible, give sufficient time to arrange for qualification before award. The responsible agency activity must, before establishing any qualification requirement, furnish notice through the GPE. The notice must include-\
(1) Intent to establish a qualification requirement;\
(2) The specification number and name of the product;\
(3) The name and address of the activity to which a request for the information and opportunity described in \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a)\
(2) should be submitted;\
(4) The anticipated date that the agency will begin awarding contracts subject to the qualification requirement;\
(5) A precautionary notice that when a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any\
specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin; and\
(6) The approximate time period following submission of a product for qualification testing within which the applicant\
will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing (see \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a)(4)).\
(b) The activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement must keep any list maintained of those already\
qualified open for inclusion of additional products, manufacturers, or other potential sources.\

\f0\b 9.206 Acquisitions subject to qualification requirements.\
9.206-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies may not enforce any QPL, QML, or QBL without first complying with the requirements of \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a). However, qualification requirements themselves, whether or not previously embodied in a in a QPL, QML, or QBL, may be enforced without regard to \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a) if they are in either of the following categories:\
(1) Any qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30,1984, for civilian agencies (not including NASA); or\
(2) Any qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action prior to October 19,1984, for DoD or NASA. Qualification requirements established after the above dates must comply with \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a) to be enforceable.\

\fs20 (b) Except when the agency head or designee determines that an emergency exists, whenever an agency elects, whether before or after award, not to enforce a qualification requirement which it established, the requirement may not thereafter be enforced unless the agency complies with \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a).\
(c) If a qualification requirement applies, the contracting officer need consider only those offers identified as meeting\
the requirement or included on the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL, unless an offeror can satisfactorily demonstrate to the contracting officer that it or its product or its subcontractor or its product can meet the standards established for qualification before the date specified for award.\
(d) If a product subject to a qualification requirement is to be acquired as a component of an end item, the contracting officer must ensure that all such components and their qualification requirements are properly identified in the solicitation since the product or source must meet the standards specified for qualification before award.\
(e) In acquisitions subject to qualification requirements, the contracting officer shall take the following steps:\
(1) Use presolicitation notices in appropriate cases to advise potential suppliers before issuing solicitations involving\
qualification requirements. The notices shall identify the specification containing the qualification requirement and establish an allowable time period, consistent with delivery requirements, for prospective offerors to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. The notice shall be publicized in accordance with \cf3 5.204\cf4 . Whether or not a presolicitation notice is used, the general synopsizing requirements of \cf3 subpart 5.2 \cf4 apply.\
(2) Distribute solicitations to prospective contractors whether or not they have been identified as meeting applicable qualification requirements.\
(3) When appropriate, request in accordance with agency procedures that a qualification requirement not be enforced in a particular acquisition and, if granted, so specify in the solicitation (see \cf3 9.206-1\cf4 (b)).\
(4) Forward requests from potential suppliers for information on a qualification requirement to the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement.\
(5) Allow the maximum time, consistent with delivery requirements, between issuing the solicitation and the contract award. As a minimum, contracting officers shall comply with the time frames specified in \cf3 5.203 \cf4 when applicable.\

\f0\b 9.206-2 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.209-1\cf4 , Qualification Requirements, in solicitations and contracts when the acquisition is subject to a qualification requirement.\

\f0\b 9.206-3 Competition.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Presolicitation
\f1\i0 . If a qualification requirement applies to an acquisition, the contracting officer shall review the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL or other identification of those sources which have met the requirement before issuing\
a solicitation to ascertain whether the number of sources is adequate for competition. (See \cf3 9.204\cf4 (a) for duties of the agency activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirement.) If the number of sources is inadequate, the contracting officer shall request the agency activity which established the requirement to-\
(1) Indicate the anticipated date on which any sources presently undergoing evaluation will have demonstrated their abilities to meet the qualification requirement so that the solicitation could be rescheduled to allow as many additional sources as possible to qualify; or\
(2) Indicate whether a means other than the qualification requirement is feasible for testing or demonstrating quality assurance.\
(b) 
\f2\i Post solicitation
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall submit to the agency activity which established the qualification requirement the names and addresses of concerns which expressed interest in the acquisition but are not included on the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL or identified as meeting the qualification requirement. The activity will then assist interested concerns in meeting the standards specified for qualification (see \cf3 9.202\cf4 (a)(2) and (4)).\

\f0\b 9.207 Changes in status regarding qualification requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall promptly report to the agency activity which established the qualification requirement any conditions which may merit removal or omission from a QPL, QML, or QBL or affect whether a source should continue to be otherwise identified as meeting the requirement. These conditions exist when-\
(1) Products or services are submitted for inspection or acceptance that do not meet the qualification requirement;\
(2) Products or services were previously rejected and the defects were not corrected when submitted for inspection or acceptance;\

\f1\b0 (3) A supplier fails to request reevaluation following change of location or ownership of the plant where the product which met the qualification requirement was manufactured (see the clause at \cf3 52.209-1\cf4 , Qualification Requirements);\
(4) A manufacturer of a product which met the qualification requirement has discontinued manufacture of the product; (5) A source requests removal from a QPL, QML, or QBL;\
(6) A condition of meeting the qualification requirement was violated; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 advertising or publicity contrary to \cf3 9.204\cf4 (h)\
(5);\
(7) A revised specification imposes a new qualification requirement;\
(8) Manufacturing or design changes have been incorporated in the qualification requirement; (9) The source is listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 ); or (10) Performance of a contract subject to a qualification requirement is otherwise unsatisfactory.\
(b) After considering any of the above or other conditions reasonably related to whether a product or source continues\
to meet the standards specified for qualification, an agency may take appropriate action without advance notification. The agency shall, however, promptly notify the affected parties if a product or source is removed from a QPL, QML, or QBL, or will no longer be identified as meeting the standards specified for qualification. This notice shall contain specific information why the product or source no longer meets the qualification requirement.\

\fs24 Subpart 9.3 - First Article Testing and Approval\

\fs20 9.301 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Approval
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means the contracting officer\'92s written notification to the contractor accepting the test results of the first article.\

\f0\b 9.302 General.\

\f1\b0 First article testing and approval (hereafter referred to as testing and approval) ensures that the contractor can furnish a product that conforms to all contract requirements for acceptance. Before requiring testing and approval, the contracting officer shall consider the-\
(a) Impact on cost or time of delivery;\
(b) Risk to the Government of foregoing such test; and\
(c) Availability of other, less costly, methods of ensuring the desired quality.\

\f0\b 9.303 Use.\

\f1\b0 Testing and approval may be appropriate when-\
(a) The contractor has not previously furnished the product to the Government; (b) The contractor previously furnished the product to the Government, but-\
(1) There have been subsequent changes in processes or specifications;\
(2) Production has been discontinued for an extended period of time; or\
(3) The product acquired under a previous contract developed a problem during its life;\
(c) The product is described by a performance specification; or\
(d) It is essential to have an approved first article to serve as a manufacturing standard.\

\f0\b 9.304 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 Normally, testing and approval is not required in contracts for-\
(a) Research or development;\
(b) Products requiring qualification before award (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 when an applicable qualified products list exists (see \cf3 subpart 9.2\cf4 )); (c) Products normally sold in the commercial market; or\
(d) Products covered by complete and detailed technical specifications, unless the requirements are so novel or exacting\
that it is questionable whether the products would meet the requirements without testing and approval.\

\f0\b 9.305 Risk.\

\f1\b0 Before first article approval, the acquisition of materials or components, or commencement of production, is normally\
at the sole risk of the contractor. To minimize this risk, the contracting officer shall provide sufficient time in the delivery schedule for acquisition of materials and components, and for production after receipt of first article approval. When Government requirements preclude this action, the contracting officer may, before approval of the first article, authorize the contractor to acquire specific materials or components or commence production to the extent essential to meet the delivery schedule (see Alternate II of the clause at \cf3 52.209-3\cf4 , First Article Approval-Contractor Testing, and Alternate II of the clause at \cf3 52.209-4\cf4 , First Article Approval-Government Testing). Costs incurred based on this authorization are allocable to the contract for\'97\
(a) Progress payments; and\
(b) Termination settlements if the contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government.\

\f0\b 9.306 Solicitation requirements.\

\f1\b0 Solicitations containing a testing and approval requirement shall-\
(a) Provide, in the circumstance where the contractor is to be responsible for the first article approval testing-\
(1) The performance or other characteristics that the first article must meet for approval;\
(2) The detailed technical requirements for the tests that must be performed for approval; and\
(3) The necessary data that must be submitted to the Government in the first article approval test report;\
(b) Provide, in the circumstance where the Government is to be responsible for the first article approval testing- (1) The performance or other characteristics that the first article must meet for approval; and\
(2) The tests to which the first article will be subjected for approval;\

\fs20 (c) Inform offerors that the requirement may be waived when supplies identical or similar to those called for have previously been delivered by the offeror and accepted by the Government (see \cf3 52.209-3\cf4 (h) and \cf3 52.209-4\cf4 (i));\
(d) Permit the submission of alternative offers, one including testing and approval and the other excluding testing and approval (if eligible under paragraph (c) of this section);\
(e) State clearly the first article\'92s relationship to the contract quantity (see paragraph (e) of the clause at \cf3 52.209-3\cf4 , First Article Approval-Contractor Testing, or \cf3 52.209-4\cf4 , First Article Approval-Government Testing);\
(f) Contain a delivery schedule for the production quantity (see \cf3 11.403\cf4 ). The delivery schedule may-\
(1) Be the same whether or not testing and approval is waived; or\
(2) Provide for earlier delivery when testing and approval is waived and the Government desires earlier delivery. In the\
latter case, any resulting difference in delivery schedules shall not be a factor in evaluation for award. The clause at \cf3 52.209-4\cf4 , First Article Approval-Government Testing, shall contain the delivery schedule for the first article;\
(g) Provide for the submission of contract numbers, if any, to document the offeror\'92s eligibility under paragraph (c) of this section;\
(h) State whether the approved first article will serve as a manufacturing standard;\
(i) Include, when the Government is responsible for first article testing, the Government\'92s estimated testing costs as a factor for use in evaluating offers (when appropriate); and\
(j) Inform offerors that the prices for first articles and first article tests in relation to production quantities shall not be materially unbalanced (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (g)) if first article test items or tests are to be separately priced.\

\f0\b 9.307 Government administration procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Before the contractor ships the first article, or the first article test report, to the Government laboratory or other activity responsible for approval at the address specified in the contract, the contract administration office shall provide that activity with as much advance notification as is feasible of the forthcoming shipment, and-\
(1) Advise that activity of the contractual requirements for testing and approval, or evaluation, as appropriate;\
(2) Call attention to the notice requirement in paragraph (b) of the clause at \cf3 52.209-3\cf4 , First Article Approval-Contractor Testing, or \cf3 52.209-4\cf4 , First Article Approval-Government Testing; and\
(3) Request that the activity inform the contract administration office of the date when testing or evaluation will be completed.\
(b) The Government laboratory or other activity responsible for first article testing or evaluation shall inform the contracting office whether to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the first article. The contracting officer shall then notify the contractor of the action taken and furnish a copy of the notice to the contract administration office. The notice shall include the first article shipment number, when available, and the applicable line item number. Any changes in the drawings, designs, or specifications determined by the contracting officer to be necessary shall be made under the Changes clause, and not by the notice of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval furnished the contractor.\

\f0\b 9.308 Contract clauses.\
9.308-1 Testing performed by the contractor.\

\fs24 Subpart 9.4 - Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) This subpart-\
(1) Prescribes policies and procedures governing the debarment and suspension of contractors by agencies for the\
causes given in \cf3 9.406-2 \cf4 and \cf3 9.407-2\cf4 ;\
(2) Provides for the listing of contractors debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, and declared ineligible (see the\
definition of "ineligible" in \cf3 2.101\cf4 ); and\
(3) Sets forth the consequences of this listing.\
(b) Although this subpart does cover the listing of ineligible contractors (\cf3 9.404\cf4 ) and the effect of this listing (\cf3 9.405\cf4 ), it does not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility except for contractors that have been declared ineligible pursuant to \cf3 10 U.S.C. 983 \cf4 (see \cf3 9.110\cf4 , and \cf3 9.405-1\cf4 (b)).\
(c) For Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act (FASCSA) orders, see subpart \cf3 4.23\cf4 .\

\f0\b 9.401 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 In accordance with Public Law 103-355, Section 2455 (\cf3 31 U.S.C.6101\cf4 , note), and Executive Order 12689, any debarment, suspension or other Governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Nonprocurement Common Rule implementing Executive Order 12549 on or after August 25, 1995, shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies as a debarment or suspension under this subpart. Similarly, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other Governmentwide exclusion initiated on or after August 25, 1995, under this subpart shall also be recognized by and effective for those agencies and participants as an exclusion under the Nonprocurement Common Rule.\

\f0\b 9.402 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall solicit offers from, award contracts to, and consent to subcontracts with responsible contractors only. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with this subpart, are appropriate means to effectuate this policy.\
(b) The serious nature of debarment and suspension requires that these sanctions be imposed only in the public interest for the Government\'92s protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies shall impose debarment or suspension to protect the Government\'92s interest and only for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart.\
(c) Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.\
(d) When more than one agency has an interest in the debarment or suspension of a contractor, the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, established under Executive Order 12549, and authorized by Section 873 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) (\cf3 31 U.S.C.6101\cf4 , note), shall resolve the lead agency issue and coordinate such resolution among all interested agencies prior to the initiation of any suspension, debarment, or related administrative action by any agency.\
(e) Agencies shall establish appropriate procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this subpart.\

\f0\b 9.405 Effect of listing.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment are excluded from receiving contracts, and agencies\
shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors, unless the agency head determines that there is a compelling reason for such action (see \cf3 9.405-1\cf4 (a)(2), \cf3 9.405-2\cf4 , \cf3 9.406-1\cf4 (c), \cf3 9.407-1\cf4 (d), and \cf3 26.505\cf2 (e)). Contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment are also excluded from conducting business with the Government as agents or representatives of other contractors.\
(b) Contractors and other entities that have an active exclusion record in SAM because they have been declared ineligible on the basis of statutory or other regulatory procedures are excluded from receiving contracts, and if applicable, subcontracts, under the conditions and for the period set forth in the statute or regulation. Agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors under those conditions and for that period.\

(3) Proposals, quotations, or offers received from any listed contractor shall not be evaluated for award or included\
in the competitive range, nor shall discussions be conducted with a listed offeror during a period of ineligibility, unless the agency head determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason to do so. If the period of ineligibility expires or is terminated prior to award, the contracting officer may, but is not required to, consider such proposals, quotations, or offers.\
(4) Immediately prior to award, the contracting officer shall again review the exclusion records in SAM to ensure that no award is made to a listed contractor.\

\f0\b 9.405-1 Continuation of current contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment
\f1\i0 . (1) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, or proposed debarment of a contractor, agencies may continue contracts or subcontracts in existence at the time the contractor was debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment unless the agency head directs otherwise. A decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken should be made only after review by agency contracting and technical personnel and by counsel to ensure the propriety of the proposed action.\
(2) For contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, unless the agency head makes a written determination of the compelling reasons for doing so, ordering activities shall not\'97\
(i) Place orders exceeding the guaranteed minimum under indefinite quantity contracts;\
(ii) Place orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreements; or\
(iii) Add new work, exercise options, or otherwise extend the duration of current contracts or orders.\

\f0\b 9.405-2 Restrictions on subcontracting.\

\f1\b0 (a) When a contractor debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment is proposed as a subcontractor for any subcontract subject to Government consent (see \cf3 subpart 44.2\cf4 ), contracting officers shall not consent to subcontracts with such contractors unless the agency head states in writing the compelling reasons for this approval action. (See \cf3 9.405 \cf4 concerning declarations of ineligibility affecting sub-contracting.)\
(b) The Government suspends or debars contractors to protect the Government\'92s interests. Contractors are prohibited from entering into any subcontract in excess of $35,000, other than a subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item, with a contractor that has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, unless there is a compelling reason to do so. If a contractor intends to enter into a subcontract in excess of $35,000, other than a subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item, with a party that is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment as evidenced by the party's having\
an active exclusion record in SAM (see \cf3 9.404\cf4 ), a corporate officer or designee of the contractor is required by operation of the clause at \cf3 52.209-6\cf4 , Protecting the Government\'92s Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment, to notify the contracting officer, in writing, before entering into such subcontract. For contracts for the acquisition of commercial products, the notification requirement applies only for first-tier subcontracts. For all other contracts, the notification requirement applies to subcontracts at any tier. The notice must provide the following:\
(1) The name of the subcontractor;\
(2) The contractor\'92s knowledge of the reasons for the subcontractor having an active exclusion record in SAM;\
(3) The compelling reason(s) for doing business with the subcontractor notwithstanding its having an active exclusion\
record in SAM; and\
(4) The systems and procedures the contractor has established to ensure that it is fully protecting the Government\'92s\
interests when dealing with such subcontractor in view of the specific basis for the party\'92s debarment, suspension, or proposed debarment.\
(c) The contractor\'92s compliance with the requirements of \cf3 52.209-6 \cf4 will be reviewed during Contractor Purchasing System Reviews (see \cf3 subpart 44.3\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 9.406 Debarment.\
9.406-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) It is the debarring official\'92s responsibility to determine whether debarment is in the Government\'92s interest. The debarring official may, in the public interest, debar a contractor for any of the causes in \cf3 9.406-2\cf4 , using the procedures in \cf3 9.406-3\cf4 . The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not necessarily require that the contractor be debarred; the seriousness of the contractor\'92s acts or omissions and any remedial measures or mitigating factors should be considered in making any debarment decision. Before arriving at any debarment decision, the debarring official should consider factors such as the following:\
(1) Whether the contractor had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time of the activity which constitutes cause for debarment or had adopted such procedures prior to any Government investigation of the activity cited as a cause for debarment.\
(2) Whether the contractor brought the activity cited as a cause for debarment to the attention of the appropriate Government agency in a timely manner.\
(3) Whether the contractor has fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.\
(4) Whether the contractor cooperated fully with Government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action.\
(5) Whether the contractor has paid or has agreed to pay all criminal, civil, and administrative liability for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the Government, and has made or agreed to make full restitution.\
(6) Whether the contractor has taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes cause for debarment.\
(7) Whether the contractor has implemented or agreed to implement remedial measures, including any identified by the Government.\

\f1\b0 (8) Whether the contractor has instituted or agreed to institute new or revised review and control procedures and ethics training programs.\
(9) Whether the contractor has had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within the contractor\'92s organization that led to the cause for debarment.\
(10) Whether the contractor\'92s management recognizes and understands the seriousness of the misconduct giving rise to the cause for debarment and has implemented programs to prevent recurrence.\
The existence or nonexistence of any mitigating factors or remedial measures such as set forth in this paragraph (a) is not necessarily determinative of a contractor\'92s present responsibility. Accordingly, if a cause for debarment exists, the contractor has the burden of demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the debarring official, its present responsibility and that debarment is not necessary.\
(b) Debarment constitutes debarment of all divisions or other organizational elements of the contractor, unless the debarment decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions, organizational elements, or commodities. The debarring official may extend the debarment decision to include any affiliates of the contractor if they are-\
(1) Specifically named; and\
(2) Given written notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to respond (see \cf3 9.406-3\cf4 (c)).\
(c) A contractor\'92s debarment, or proposed debarment, shall be effective throughout the executive branch of the\
Government, unless the agency head or a designee (except see \cf3 26.505\cf2 (e)) states in writing the compelling reasons justifying continued business dealings between that agency and the contractor.\
(d) (1) When the debarring official has authority to debar contractors from both acquisition contracts pursuant to this regulation and contracts for the purchase of Federal personal property pursuant to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) 101-45.6, that official shall consider simultaneously debarring the contractor from the award of acquisition contracts and from the purchase of Federal personal property.\
(2) When debarring a contractor from the award of acquisition contracts and from the purchase of Federal personal property, the debarment notice shall so indicate and the appropriate FAR and FPMR citations shall be included.\

\f0\b 9.406-2 Causes for debarment.\

\f1\b0 The debarring official may debar-\
(a) A contractor for a conviction of or civil judgment for-\
(1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with- (i) Obtaining;\
(ii) Attempting to obtain; or\
(iii) Performing a public contract or subcontract.\
(2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers;\
(3) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;\
(4) Intentionally affixing a label bearing a "Made in America" inscription (or any inscription having the same meaning) to a product sold in or shipped to the United States or its outlying areas, when the product was not made in the United States or its outlying areas (see Section 202 of the Defense Production Act (Public Law102-558)); or\
(5) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of a Government contractor or subcontractor.\
(b) (1) A contractor, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, for any of the following-\
(i) Violation of the terms of a Government contract or subcontract so serious as to justify debarment, such as-\
(A) Willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; or\
(B) A history of failure to perform, or of unsatisfactory performance of, one or more contracts. (ii) Violations of \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 81\cf4 , Drug-Free Workplace, as indicated by-\
(A) Failure to comply with the requirements of the clause at \cf3 52.226-7\cf2 , Drug-Free Workplace; or\
(B) Such a number of contractor employees convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes occurring in the workplace as to indicate that the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace (see \cf3 26.504\cf2 ).\
(iii) Intentionally affixing a label bearing a "Made in America" inscription (or any inscription having the same meaning) to a product sold in or shipped to the United States or its outlying areas, when the product was not made in the United States or its outlying areas (see Section 202 of the Defense Production Act (Public Law102-558)).\

\fs20 (iv) Commission of an unfair trade practice as defined in \cf3 9.403 \cf4 (see Section 201 of the Defense Production Act (Pub.L.102-558)).\
(v) Delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $10;000.\
(A) Federal taxes are considered delinquent for purposes of this provision if both of the following criteria apply:\

\f2\i (1) The tax liability is finally determined. 
\f1\i0 The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.\

\f2\i (2) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. 
\f1\i0 A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.\
(B) Examples. 
\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. \'a76212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. \'a76320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity\
to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\

\f2\i (3) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. \'a76159. 
\f1\i0 The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.\

\f2\i (4) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
\f1\i0 The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).\
(vi) Knowing failure by a principal, until 3 years after final payment on any Government contract awarded to the contractor, to timely disclose to the Government, in connection with the award, performance, or closeout of the contract or a subcontract thereunder, credible evidence of-\
(A) Violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code;\
(B) Violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733); or\
(C) Significant overpayment(s) on the contract, other than overpayments resulting from contract financing payments as defined in \cf3 32.001\cf4 .\
(vii) Determination of a false certification under \cf3 52.209-13\cf4 , Violation of Arms Control Treaties or Agreements- Certification.\
(2) A contractor, based on a determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General of the United States, that the contractor is not in compliance with Immigration and Nationality Act employment provisions (see Executive Order12989, as amended by Executive Order13286). Such determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.\
(c) A contractor or subcontractor based on any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects the present responsibility of the contractor or subcontractor.\

\f0\b 9.406-3 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Investigation and referral
\f1\i0 . Agencies shall establish procedures for the prompt reporting, investigation, and referral to the debarring official of matters appropriate for that official\'92s consideration.\
(b) Decisionmaking process. (1) Agencies shall establish procedures governing the debarment decisionmaking process that are as informal as is practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness. These procedures shall afford the contractor (and any specifically named affiliates) an opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment.\
(2) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if it is found that the contractor\'92s submission in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, agencies shall also-\
(i) Afford the contractor an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the agency presents; and\

(2) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to put the contractor on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based;\
(3) Of the cause(s) relied upon under \cf3 9.406-2 \cf4 for proposing debarment;\
(4) That, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the contractor may submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment, including any additional specific information that raises a genuine dispute over the material facts;\
(5) Of the agency\'92s procedures governing debarment decisionmaking; (6) Of the effect of the issuance of the notice of proposed debarment; and (7) Of the potential effect of an actual debarment.\
(d) 
\f2\i Debarring official\'92s decision
\f1\i0 . (1) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no\
genuine dispute over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the contractor. If no suspension is in effect, the decision shall be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the contractor, unless the debarring official extends this period for good cause.\
(2) (i) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the contractor and any other information in the administrative record.\
(ii) The debarring official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.\
(iii) The debarring official\'92s decision shall be made after the conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.\
(3) In any action in which the proposed debarment is not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the cause for debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\
(e) Notice of debarring official\'92s decision. (1) If the debarring official decides to impose debarment, the contractor and any affiliates involved shall be given prompt notice by certified mail, return receipt requested-\
(i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;\
(ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;\
(iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; and\
(iv) Advising that the debarment is effective throughout the executive branch of the Government unless the head of\
an agency or a designee makes the statement called for by \cf3 9.406-1\cf4 (c).\
(2) If debarment is not imposed, the debarring official shall promptly notify the contractor and any affiliates involved,\
by certified mail, return receipt requested.\
(f) (1) If the contractor enters into an administrative agreement with the Government in order to resolve a debarment\
proceeding, the debarring official shall access the website (available at \cf3 https://www.cpars.gov\cf4 , then select FAPIIS) and enter the requested information.\
(2) The debarring official is responsible for the timely submission, within 3 working days, and accuracy of the documentation regarding the administrative agreement.\
(3) With regard to information that may be covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the debarring official shall follow the procedures at \cf3 9.105-2\cf4 (b)(2)(iv).\

\f0\b 9.406-4 Period of debarment.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the seriousness of the cause(s). Generally, debarment should not exceed 3 years, except that-\
(i) Debarment for violation of the provisions of \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 81\cf4 , Drug-Free Workplace (see \cf3 26.505\cf2 ) may be for a period not to exceed 5 years;\

\fs20 (iii) Debarments under \cf3 9.406-2\cf4 (b)(1)(vii) shall be for a period of not less than 2 years, inclusive of any suspension period, if suspension precedes a debarment (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section).\
(2) If suspension precedes a debarment, the suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment period. (b) The debarring official may extend the debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension\
is necessary to protect the Government\'92s interest. However, a debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based. Debarments under \cf3 9.406-2\cf4 (b)(2) may be extended for additional periods of one year if the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that the contractor continues to be in violation of the employment provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. If debarment for an additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of \cf3 9.406-3 \cf4 shall be followed to extend the debarment.\
(c) The debarring official may reduce the period or extent of debarment, upon the contractor\'92s request, supported by documentation, for reasons such as-\
(1) Newly discovered material evidence;\
(2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the debarment was based; (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;\
(4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or\

\f0\b 9.406-5 Scope of debarment.\

\f1\b0 (a) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with a contractor may be imputed to the contractor when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual\'92s performance of duties for or on behalf of the contractor, or with the contractor\'92s knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The contractor\'92s acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.\
(b) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a contractor may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with the contractor who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the contractor\'92s conduct.\
(c) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of one contractor participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participating contractors if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement, or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these contractors. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.\

\f0\b 9.407 Suspension.\
9.407-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a contractor for any of the causes in \cf3 9.407-2\cf4 , using the procedures in \cf3 9.407-3\cf4 .\
(b) (1) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed on the basis of adequate evidence, pending the completion\
of investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the Government\'92s interest. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, agencies should consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment should include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, inspection reports, and correspondence.\
(2) The existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that the contractor be suspended. The suspending official should consider the seriousness of the contractor\'92s acts or omissions and may, but is not required to, consider remedial measures or mitigating factors, such as those set forth in \cf3 9.406-1\cf4 (a). A contractor has the burden of promptly presenting to the suspending official evidence of remedial measures or mitigating factors when it has reason to know that a cause for suspension exists. The existence or nonexistence of any remedial measures or mitigating factors is not necessarily determinative of a contractor\'92s present responsibility.\
(c) Suspension constitutes suspension of all divisions or other organizational elements of the contractor, unless the suspension decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions, organizational elements, or commodities. The suspending official may extend the suspension decision to include any affiliates of the contractor if they are-\
(1) Specifically named; and\
(2) Given written notice of the suspension and an opportunity to respond (see \cf3 9.407-3\cf4 (c)).\

(e) (1) When the suspending official has authority to suspend contractors from both acquisition contracts pursuant to this regulation and contracts for the purchase of Federal personal property pursuant to FPMR 101-45.6, that official shall consider simultaneously suspending the contractor from the award of acquisition contracts and from the purchase of Federal personal property.\

(iii) The suspending official\'92s decision shall be made after the conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.\
(3) The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension or leave it in force (for example, see \cf3 9.406-4\cf4 (c) for the reasons for reducing the period or extent of debarment). However, a decision to modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of-\
(i) Suspension by any other agency; or\
(ii) Debarment by any agency.\
(4) Prompt written notice of the suspending official\'92s decision shall be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved,\
by certified mail, return receipt requested.\
(e) (1) If the contractor enters into an administrative agreement with the Government in order to resolve a suspension\
proceeding, the suspending official shall access the website (available at \cf3 https://www.cpars.gov\cf4 , then select FAPIIS) and enter the requested information.\

\fs24 Subpart 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest\

\fs20 9.500 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart-\
(a) Prescribes responsibilities, general rules, and procedures for identifying, evaluating, and resolving organizational conflicts of interest;\
(b) Provides examples to assist contracting officers in applying these rules and procedures to individual contracting situations; and\
(c) Implements section 8141 of the 1989 Department of Defense Appropriation Act, Pub.L.100-463, 102 Stat.2270-47 (1988).\

\f0\b 9.501 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Marketing consultant
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means any independent contractor who furnishes advice, information, direction, or assistance to an offeror or any other contractor in support of the preparation or submission of an offer for a Government contract by that offeror. An independent contractor is not a marketing consultant when rendering-\
(1) Services excluded in \cf3 subpart 37.2\cf4 ;\
(2) Routine engineering and technical services (such as installation, operation, or maintenance of systems, equipment, software, components, or facilities);\
(3) Routine legal, actuarial, auditing, and accounting services; and (4) Training services.\

\f0\b 9.502 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart applies to contracts with either profit or nonprofit organizations, including nonprofit organizations created largely or wholly with Government funds.\
(b) The applicability of this subpart is not limited to any particular kind of acquisition. However, organizational conflicts of interest are more likely to occur in contracts involving-\
(1) Management support services;\
(2) Consultant or other professional services;\
(3) Contractor performance of or assistance in technical evaluations; or\
(4) Systems engineering and technical direction work performed by a contractor that does not have overall contractual\
responsibility for development or production.\
(c) An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on an\
instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. In the latter case, some restrictions on future activities of the contractor may be required.\
(d) Acquisitions subject to unique agency organizational conflict of interest statutes are excluded from the requirements of this subpart.\

\f0\b 9.503 Waiver.\

\f1\b0 The agency head or a designee may waive any general rule or procedure of this subpart by determining that its application in a particular situation would not be in the Government\'92s interest. Any request for waiver must be in writing, shall set forth the extent of the conflict, and requires approval by the agency head or a designee. Agency heads shall not delegate waiver authority below the level of head of a contracting activity.\

\f0\b 9.504 Contracting officer responsibilities.\

\f1\b0 (a) Using the general rules, procedures, and examples in this subpart, contracting officers shall analyze planned acquisitions in order to-\
(1) Identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as early in the acquisition process as possible; and\
(2) Avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts before contract award.\
(b) Contracting officers should obtain the advice of counsel and the assistance of appropriate technical specialists in\
evaluating potential conflicts and in developing any necessary solicitation provisions and contract clauses (see \cf3 9.506\cf4 ).\
(c) Before issuing a solicitation for a contract that may involve a significant potential conflict, the contracting officer shall\
recommend to the head of the contracting activity a course of action for resolving the conflict (see \cf3 9.506\cf4 ).\

\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (d) In fulfilling their responsibilities for identifying and resolving potential conflicts, contracting officers should avoid creating unnecessary delays, burdensome information requirements, and excessive documentation. The contracting officer\'92s judgment need be formally documented only when a substantive issue concerning potential organizational conflict of interest exists.\
(e) The contracting officer shall award the contract to the apparent successful offeror unless a conflict of interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided or mitigated. Before determining to withhold award based on conflict of interest considerations, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor, provide the reasons therefor, and allow the contractor a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver shall be submitted in accordance with \cf3 9.503\cf4 . The waiver request and decision shall be included in the contract file.\

\f0\b 9.505 General rules.\

\f1\b0 The general rules in \cf3 9.505-1 \cf4 through \cf3 9.505-4 \cf4 prescribe limitations on contracting as the means of avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest that might otherwise exist in the stated situations. Some illustrative examples are provided in \cf3 9.508\cf4 . Conflicts may arise in situations not expressly covered in this section \cf3 9.505 \cf4 or in the examples in \cf3 9.508\cf4 . Each individual contracting situation should be examined on the basis of its particular facts and the nature of the proposed contract. The exercise of common sense, good judgment, and sound discretion is required in both the decision on whether a significant potential conflict exists and, if it does, the development of an appropriate means for resolving it. The two underlying principles are-\
(a) Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor\'92s judgment; and\
(b) Preventing unfair competitive advantage. In addition to the other situations described in this subpart, an unfair competitive advantage exists where a contractor competing for award of any Federal contract possesses-\
(1) Proprietary information that was obtained from a Government official without proper authorization; or\
(2) Source selection information (as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) that is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and such information would assist that contractor in obtaining the contract.\

\f0\b 9.505-1 Providing systems engineering and technical direction.\

\f1\b0 (a) A contractor that provides systems engineering and technical direction for a system but does not have overall contractual responsibility for its development, its integration, assembly, and checkout, or its production shall not-\
(1) Be awarded a contract to supply the system or any of its major components; or\
(2) Be a subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its major components.\
(b) Systems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities: determining specifications,\
identifying and resolving interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, and supervising design. Technical direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities: developing work statements, determining parameters, directing other contractors\'92 operations, and resolving technical controversies. In performing these activities, a contractor occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a system\'92s basic concepts and supervising their execution by other contractors. Therefore this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.\

\f0\b 9.505-2 Preparing specifications or work statements.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) If a contractor prepares and furnishes complete specifications covering nondevelopmental items, to be used in\
a competitive acquisition, that contractor shall not be allowed to furnish these items, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor, for a reasonable period of time including, at least, the duration of the initial production contract. The restriction in this paragraph (a)(1) shall not apply to-\
(i) Contractors that furnish at Government request specifications or data regarding a product they provide, even though the specifications or data may have been paid for separately or in the price of the product; or\
(ii) Situations in which contractors, acting as industry representatives, help Government agencies prepare, refine, or coordinate specifications, regardless of source, provided this assistance is supervised and controlled by Government representatives.\
(2) If a single contractor drafts complete specifications for nondevelopmental equipment, it should be eliminated for a reasonable time from competition for production based on the specifications. This should be done in order to avoid a situation in which the contractor could draft specifications favoring its own products or capabilities. In this way the Government can\

\f1\b0 be assured of getting unbiased advice as to the content of the specifications and can avoid allegations of favoritism in the award of production contracts.\
(3) In development work, it is normal to select firms that have done the most advanced work in the field. These firms can be expected to design and develop around their own prior knowledge. Development contractors can frequently start production earlier and more knowledgeably than firms that did not participate in the development, and this can affect the time and quality of production, both of which are important to the Government. In many instances the Government may have financed the development. Thus, while the development contractor has a competitive advantage, it is an unavoidable one that is not considered unfair; hence no prohibition should be imposed.\
(b) (1) If a contractor prepares, or assists in preparing, a work statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services-or provides material leading directly, predictably, and without delay to such a work statement-that contractor may not supply the system, major components of the system, or the services unless-\
(i) It is the sole source;\
(ii) It has participated in the development and design work; or\
(iii) More than one contractor has been involved in preparing the work statement.\
(2) Agencies should normally prepare their own work statements. When contractor assistance is necessary, the contractor might often be in a position to favor its own products or capabilities. To overcome the possibility of bias, contractors are prohibited from supplying a system or services acquired on the basis of work statements growing out of their services, unless excepted in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\
(3) For the reasons given in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no prohibitions are imposed on development and design contractors.\

\f0\b 9.505-3 Providing evaluation services.\

\f1\b0 Contracts for the evaluation of offers for products or services shall not be awarded to a contractor that will evaluate its own offers for products or services, or those of a competitor, without proper safeguards to ensure objectivity to protect the Government\'92s interests.\

\f0\b 9.505-4 Obtaining access to proprietary information.\

\f1\b0 (a) When a contractor requires proprietary information from others to perform a Government contract and can use the leverage of the contract to obtain it, the contractor may gain an unfair competitive advantage unless restrictions are imposed. These restrictions protect the information and encourage companies to provide it when necessary for contract performance. They are not intended to protect information-\
(1) Furnished voluntarily without limitations on its use; or\
(2) Available to the Government or contractor from other sources without restriction.\
(b) A contractor that gains access to proprietary information of other companies in performing advisory and assistance\
services for the Government must agree with the other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. The contracting officer shall obtain copies of these agreements and ensure that they are properly executed.\
(c) Contractors also obtain proprietary and source selection information by acquiring the services of marketing consultants which, if used in connection with an acquisition, may give the contractor an unfair competitive advantage. Contractors should make inquiries of marketing consultants to ensure that the marketing consultant has provided no unfair competitive advantage.\

\f0\b 9.506 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) If information concerning prospective contractors is necessary to identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest or to develop recommended actions, contracting officers first should seek the information from within the Government or from other readily available sources. Government sources include the files and the knowledge of personnel within the contracting office, other contracting offices, the cognizant contract administration and audit activities and offices concerned with contract financing. Non-Government sources include publications and commercial services, such as credit rating services, trade and financial journals, and business directories and registers.\
(b) If the contracting officer decides that a particular acquisition involves a significant potential organizational conflict of interest, the contracting officer shall, before issuing the solicitation, submit for approval to the chief of the contracting office (unless a higher level official is designated by the agency)-\

\fs20 (1) A written analysis, including a recommended course of action for avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating the conflict, based on the general rules in \cf3 9.505 \cf4 or on another basis not expressly stated in that section;\
(2) A draft solicitation provision (see \cf3 9.507-1\cf4 ); and\
(3) If appropriate, a proposed contract clause (see \cf3 9.507-2\cf4 ). (c) The approving official shall-\
(1) Review the contracting officer\'92s analysis and recommended course of action, including the draft provision and any proposed clause;\
(2) Consider the benefits and detriments to the Government and prospective contractors; and\
(3) Approve, modify, or reject the recommendations in writing. (d) The contracting officer shall-\
(1) Include the approved provision(s) and any approved clause(s) in the solicitation or the contract, or both;\
(2) Consider additional information provided by prospective contractors in response to the solicitation or during negotiations; and\
(3) Before awarding the contract, resolve the conflict or the potential conflict in a manner consistent with the approval or other direction by the head of the contracting activity.\
(e) If, during the effective period of any restriction (see \cf3 9.507\cf4 ), a contracting office transfers acquisition responsibility for the item or system involved, it shall notify the successor contracting office of the restriction, and send a copy of the contract under which the restriction was imposed.\

\f0\b 9.507 Solicitation provisions and contract clause.\
9.507-1 Solicitation provisions.\

\f1\b0 As indicated in the general rules in \cf3 9.505\cf4 , significant potential organizational conflicts of interest are normally resolved by imposing some restraint, appropriate to the nature of the conflict, upon the contractor\'92s eligibility for future contracts or subcontracts. Therefore, affected solicitations shall contain a provision that-\
(a) Invites offerors\'92 attention to this subpart;\
(b) States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the contracting officer;\
(c) States the nature of the proposed restraint upon future contractor activities; and\
(d) Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether or not the terms of any proposed clause and the application\
of this subpart to the contract are subject to negotiation.\

\f0\b 9.507-2 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 (a) If, as a condition of award, the contractor\'92s eligibility for future prime contract or subcontract awards will be restricted or the contractor must agree to some other restraint, the solicitation shall contain a proposed clause that specifies both the nature and duration of the proposed restraint. The contracting officer shall include the clause in the contract, first negotiating the clause\'92s final terms with the successful offeror, if it is appropriate to do so (see \cf3 9.506\cf4 (d)).\
(b) The restraint imposed by a clause shall be limited to a fixed term of reasonable duration, sufficient to avoid the circumstance of unfair competitive advantage or potential bias. This period varies. It might end, for example, when the\
first production contract using the contractor\'92s specifications or work statement is awarded, or it might extend through the entire life of a system for which the contractor has performed systems engineering and technical direction. In every case, the restriction shall specify termination by a specific date or upon the occurrence of an identifiable event.\

\f0\b 9.508 Examples.\

\f1\b0 The examples in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section illustrate situations in which questions concerning organizational conflicts of interest may arise. They are not all inclusive, but are intended to help the contracting officer apply the general rules in \cf3 9.505 \cf4 to individual contract situations.\
(a) Company A agrees to provide systems engineering and technical direction for the Navy on the powerplant for a group of submarines (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 turbines, drive shafts, propellers, etc.). Company A should not be allowed to supply any powerplant components. Company A can, however, supply components of the submarine unrelated to the powerplant (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 fire control, navigation, etc.). In this example, the system is the powerplant, not the submarine, and the ban on supplying components is limited to those for the system only.\
(b) Company A is the systems engineering and technical direction contractor for system X. After some progress, but before completion, the system is canceled. Later, system Y is developed to achieve the same purposes as system X, but in\

\f1\b0 a fundamentally different fashion. Company B is the systems engineering and technical direction contractor for system Y. Company A may supply system Y or its components.\
(c) Company A develops new electronic equipment and, as a result of this development, prepares specifications. Company A may supply the equipment.\
(d) XYZ Tool Company and PQR Machinery Company, representing the American Tool Institute, work under Government supervision and control to refine specifications or to clarify the requirements of a specific acquisition. These companies may supply the item.\
(e) Before an acquisition for information technology is conducted, Company A is awarded a contract to prepare data system specifications and equipment performance criteria to be used as the basis for the equipment competition. Since the specifications are the basis for selection of commercial hardware, a potential conflict of interest exists. Company A should be excluded from the initial follow-on information technology hardware acquisition.\
(f) Company A receives a contract to define the detailed performance characteristics an agency will require for purchasing rocket fuels. Company A has not developed the particular fuels. When the definition contract is awarded, it is clear to both parties that the agency will use the performance characteristics arrived at to choose competitively a contractor to develop or produce the fuels. Company A may not be awarded this follow-on contract.\
(g) Company A receives a contract to prepare a detailed plan for scientific and technical training of an agency\'92s personnel. It suggests a curriculum that the agency endorses and incorporates in its request for proposals to institutions to establish and conduct the training. Company A may not be awarded a contract to conduct the training.\
(h) Company A is selected to study the use of lasers in communications. The agency intends to ask that firms doing research in the field make proprietary information available to Company A. The contract must require Company A to-\
(1) Enter into agreements with these firms to protect any proprietary information they provide; and\
(2) Refrain from using the information in supplying lasers to the Government or for any purpose other than that for which it was intended.\
(i) An agency that regulates an industry wishes to develop a system for evaluating and processing license applications. Contractor X helps develop the system and process the applications. Contractor X should be prohibited from acting as a consultant to any of the applicants during its period of performance and for a reasonable period thereafter.\

\fs24 Subpart 9.6 - Contractor Team Arrangements\

\fs20 9.601 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Contractor team arrangement
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means an arrangement in which-\
(1) Two or more companies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential prime contractor; or\
(2) A potential prime contractor agrees with one or more other companies to have them act as its subcontractors under a\
specified Government contract or acquisition program.\

\f0\b 9.602 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contractor team arrangements may be desirable from both a Government and industry standpoint in order to enable the companies involved to-\
(1) Complement each other\'92s unique capabilities; and\
(2) Offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost, and delivery for the system or product being acquired.\
(b) Contractor team arrangements may be particularly appropriate in complex research and development acquisitions, but may be used in other appropriate acquisitions, including production.\
(c) The companies involved normally form a contractor team arrangement before submitting an offer. However, they may enter into an arrangement later in the acquisition process, including after contract award.\

\f0\b 9.603 Policy.\

\f1\b0 The Government will recognize the integrity and validity of contractor team arrangements; 
\f2\i provided
\f1\i0 , the arrangements are identified and company relationships are fully disclosed in an offer or, for arrangements entered into after submission of an offer, before the arrangement becomes effective. The Government will not normally require or encourage the dissolution of contractor team arrangements.\

\f0\b 9.604 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 Nothing in this subpart authorizes contractor team arrangements in violation of antitrust statutes or limits the Government\'92s rights to-\
(a) Require consent to subcontracts (see \cf3 subpart 44.2\cf4 );\
(b) Determine, on the basis of the stated contractor team arrangement, the responsibility of the prime contractor (see \cf3 subpart 9.1\cf4 );\
(c) Provide to the prime contractor data rights owned or controlled by the Government;\
(d) Pursue its policies on competitive contracting, subcontracting, and component breakout after initial production or at any other time; and\
(e) Hold the prime contractor fully responsible for contract performance, regardless of any team arrangement between the prime contractor and its subcontractors.\

\fs24 Subpart 9.7 - Defense Production Pools and Research and Development Pools\

\fs20 9.701 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Pool
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means a group of concerns (see \cf3 19.001 \cf4 ) that have-\
(1) Associated together in order to obtain and perform, jointly or in conjunction with each other, defense production or\
research and development contracts;\
(2) Entered into an agreement governing their organization, relationship, and procedures; and (3) Obtained approval of the agreement by either-\
(i) The Small Business Administration (SBA) under section 9 or 11 of the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C.638 \cf4 or 640) (see 13 CFR125); or\
(ii) A designated official under PartV of Executive Order10480, August 14,1953 (18 FR4939, August 20,1953) and section 708 of the Defense Production Act of1950 (\cf3 50 U.S.C. App.2158\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 9.702 Contracting with pools.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as specified in this subpart, a pool shall be treated the same as any other prospective or actual contractor.\
(b) The contracting officer shall not award a contract to a pool unless the offer leading to the contract is submitted by the pool in its own name or by an individual pool member expressly stating that the offer is on behalf of the pool.\
(c) Upon receipt of an offer submitted by a group representing that it is a pool, the contracting officer shall verify its approved status with the SBA District Office Director or other approving agency and document the contract file that the verification was made.\
(d) Pools approved by the SBA under the Small Business Act are entitled to the preferences and privileges accorded to small business concerns. Approval under the Defense Production Act does not confer these preferences and privileges.\
(e) Before awarding a contract to an unincorporated pool, the contracting officer shall require each pool member participating in the contract to furnish a certified copy of a power of attorney identifying the agent authorized to sign the offer or contract on that member\'92s behalf. The contracting officer shall attach a copy of each power of attorney to each signed copy of the contract retained by the Government.\

\f0\b 9.703 Contracting with individual pool members.\

\f1\b0 (a) Pool members may submit individual offers, independent of the pool. However, the contracting officer shall not consider an independent offer by a pool member if that pool member participates in a competing offer submitted by the pool.\
(b) If a pool member submits an individual offer, independent of the pool, the contracting officer shall consider the pool agreement, along with other factors, in determining whether that pool member is a responsible prospective contractor under \cf3 subpart 9.1\cf4 .\

\fs20 (d) See \cf3 10.003 \cf4 for the requirement for a prime contractor to perform market research in contracts in excess of $6 million,\
other than contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services (section 826 of Pub. L. 110-181).\

\f0\b 10.002 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Acquisitions begin with a description of the Government\'92s needs stated in terms sufficient to allow conduct of market research.\
(b) Market research is then conducted to determine if commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items are available to meet the Government\'92s needs or could be modified to meet the Government\'92s needs.\
(1) The extent of market research will vary, depending on such factors as urgency, estimated dollar value, complexity, and past experience. The contracting officer may use market research conducted within 18 months before the award of\
any task or delivery order if the information is still current, accurate, and relevant. Market research involves obtaining information specific to the product or service being acquired and should include-\
(i) Whether the Government\'92s needs can be met by-\
(A) Products or services of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace;\
(B) Products or services of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace with modifications; or (C) Products or services used exclusively for governmental purposes;\
(ii) Customary practices regarding customizing, modifying or tailoring of products or services to meet customer needs and associated costs;\
(iii) Customary practices, including warranty, buyer financing, discounts, contract type considering the nature and risk associated with the requirement, etc., under which commercial sales of the products or services are made;\
(iv) The requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the item being acquired;\
(v) The availability of items that contain recovered materials and items that are energy efficient;\
(vi) The distribution and support capabilities of potential suppliers, including alternative arrangements and cost\
estimates; and\
(vii) Whether the Government's needs can be met by small business concerns that will likely submit a competitive\
offer at fair market prices (see \cf3 part 19\cf4 ).\
(2) Techniques for conducting market research may include any or all of the following:\
(i) Contacting knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry regarding market capabilities to meet requirements.\
(ii) Reviewing the results of recent market research undertaken to meet similar or identical requirements.\
(iii) Publishing formal requests for information in appropriate technical or scientific journals or business publications.\
(iv) Querying the Governmentwide database of contracts and other procurement instruments intended for use by multiple agencies available at \cf3 https://www.contractdirectory.gov/contractdirectory/ \cf4 and other Government and commercial databases that provide information relevant to agency acquisitions.\
(v) Participating in interactive, on-line communication among industry, acquisition personnel, and customers.\
(vi) Obtaining source lists of similar items from other contracting activities or agencies, trade associations or other sources.\
(vii) Reviewing catalogs and other generally available product literature published by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers or available on-line.\
(viii) Conducting interchange meetings or holding presolicitation conferences to involve potential offerors early in the acquisition process.\
(ix) Reviewing systems such as the System for Award Management, the Federal Procurement Data System, and the Small Business Administration's Dynamic Small Business Search.\
(c) If market research indicates commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items might not be available to satisfy agency needs, agencies shall reevaluate the need in accordance with \cf3 10.001\cf4 (a)(3)(ii) and determine whether the need can be restated to permit commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items to satisfy the agency\'92s needs.\
(d) (1) If market research establishes that the Government\'92s need may be met by a type of product or service customarily available in the commercial marketplace that would meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service at \cf3 subpart 2.1\cf4 , the contracting officer shall solicit and award any resultant contract using the policies and procedures in \cf3 part 12\cf4 .\

When publication of the notice at \cf3 5.201 \cf4 is required, the contracting officer shall include a notice to prospective offerors that the Government does not intend to use \cf3 part 12 \cf4 for the acquisition.\
(e) The head of the agency shall document the results of market research in a manner appropriate to the size and complexity of the acquisition.\

\fs28 FAC 2024-05 May 22, 2024\

\f0\b\fs20 11.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures for describing agency needs.\

\f0\b 11.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Reconditioned 
\f1\i0 means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement. 
\f2\i Remanufactured 
\f1\i0 means factory rebuilt to original specifications.\

\f0\b 11.002 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) In fulfilling requirements of \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(a)\cf4 , \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3453\cf4 , \cf3 41 U.S.C.3306(a)\cf4 , and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3307\cf4 , agencies shall- (1) Specify needs using market research in a manner designed to-\
(i) Promote full and open competition (see \cf3 part 6\cf4 ), or maximum practicable competition when using simplified acquisition procedures, with due regard to the nature of the supplies or services to be acquired; and\
(ii) Only include restrictive provisions or conditions to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the agency or as authorized by law.\
(2) To the maximum extent practicable, ensure that acquisition officials-\
(i) State requirements with respect to an acquisition of supplies or services in terms of-\
(A) Functions to be performed;\
(B) Performance required; or\
(C) Essential physical characteristics;\
(ii) Define requirements in terms that enable and encourage offerors to supply commercial products or commercial services or, to the extent that commercial products suitable to meet the agency\'92s needs are not available, nondevelopmental items, in response to the agency solicitations;\
(iii) Provide offerors of commercial products, commercial services, and nondevelopmental items an opportunity to compete in any acquisition to fill such requirements;\
(iv) Require prime contractors and subcontractors at all tiers under the agency contracts to incorporate commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items as components of items supplied to the agency; and\
(v) Modify requirements in appropriate cases to ensure that the requirements can be met by commercial products or commercial services or, to the extent that commercial products suitable to meet the agency\'92s needs are not available, nondevelopmental items.\
(b) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (\cf3 15 U.S.C.205a\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq.
\f1\i0 ), designates the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce, and it requires that each agency use the metric system of measurement in its acquisitions, except to the extent that such use is impracticable or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. Requiring activities are responsible for establishing guidance implementing this policy in formulating their requirements for acquisitions.\
(c) To the extent practicable and consistent with \cf3 subpart 9.5\cf4 , potential offerors should be given an opportunity to comment on agency requirements or to recommend application and tailoring of requirements documents and alternative approaches. Requiring agencies should apply specifications, standards, and related documents initially for guidance only, making final decisions on the application and tailoring of these documents as a product of the design and development process. Requiring agencies should not dictate detailed design solutions prematurely (see \cf3 7.101 \cf4 and \cf3 7.105\cf4 (a)(8)).\
(d) (1) \cf2 Agencies shall procure sustainable products and services (as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf2 ) in accordance with subpart \cf3 23.1\cf2 ). (2) Unless it is not practicable (see \cf3 23.104\cf2 (a)) or an exception or exemption applies (see \cf3 23.105 \cf2 and \cf3 23.106\cf2 ,\
respectively), agencies shall incorporate the use of sustainable products and services when\'97\
(i) Developing, reviewing, or revising Federal and military specifications, product descriptions (including\
commercial item descriptions) and standards;\
(ii) Describing Government requirements for products and services; and (iii) Developing source-selection factors.\
(3) The Green Procurement Compilation (GPC) available at 
\f2\i \cf3 https://sftool.gov/greenprocurement 
\f1\i0 \cf2 provides a comprehensive list of sustainable products and services and other related sustainable acquisition guidance. Agencies should \'97\
(i) Consult the GPC when determining which purchasing programs apply to a specific product or service; and\

\fs20 (ii) Incorporate into agency requirements any required standards, specifications, or ecolabels identified in the GPC for a specific product or service.\
(e) Some or all of the performance levels or performance specifications in a solicitation may be identified as targets rather than as fixed or minimum requirements.\
(f) In accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\cf3 29 U.S.C. 794d\cf4 ), the contracting officer shall obtain from the requiring activity the requirement documents, which must identify\'97\
(1) The needs of current and future users with disabilities to determine how\'96\
(i) Users with disabilities will perform the functions supported by the information and communication technology\
(ICT);\
(ii) The ICT will be developed, installed, configured and maintained to support users with disabilities;\
(2) The applicable ICT accessibility standards (see \cf3 subpart 39.2\cf4 ); and\
(3) Any ICT accessibility standards that cannot be met due to an exception or an exemption for any component or portion of the product (see \cf3 7.105\cf4 (b)(5)(iv), \cf3 39.204\cf4 , and \cf3 39.205\cf4 ).\
(g) Unless the agency Chief Information Officer waives the requirement, when acquiring information technology using Internet Protocol, the requirements documents must include reference to the appropriate technical capabilities defined in\
the USGv6 Profile (NIST Special Publication 500-267) and the corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program. The applicability of IPv6 to agency networks, infrastructure, and applications specific to individual acquisitions will be in accordance with the agency's Enterprise Architecture (see OMB Memorandum M-05-22 dated August 2, 2005).\
(h) Agencies shall not include in a solicitation a requirement that prohibits an offeror from permitting its employees to telecommute unless the contracting officer executes a written determination in accordance with FAR \cf3 7.108\cf4 (a).\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 11.1 - Selecting and Developing Requirements Documents\

\fs20 11.101 Order of precedence for requirements documents.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies may select from existing requirements documents, modify or combine existing requirements documents, or create new requirements documents to meet agency needs, consistent with the following order of precedence:\
(1) Documents mandated for use by law.\
(2) Performance-oriented documents (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 a PWS or SOO). (See \cf3 2.101\cf4 .)\
(3) Detailed design-oriented documents.\
(4) Standards, specifications and related publications issued by the Government outside the Defense or Federal series\
for the non-repetitive acquisition of items.\
(b) In accordance with OMB Circular A-119, "Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus\
Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities," and Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-113 (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 272 \cf4 note), agencies must use voluntary consensus standards, when they exist, in lieu of Government-unique standards, except where inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical. The private sector manages and administers voluntary consensus standards. Such standards are not mandated by law (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , industry standards such as ISO 9000, and IEEE 1680).\

\f0\b 11.102 Standardization program.\

\f1\b0 Agencies shall select existing requirements documents or develop new requirements documents that meet the needs of the agency in accordance with the guidance contained in the Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001; for DoD components, DoD Manual 4120.24, Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Procedures; and for IT standards and guidance, the Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS). The Federal Standardization Manual may be obtained from the General Services Administration (see address in \cf3 11.201\cf4 (d)(1)). DoD Manual 4120.24 may be obtained from DoD (\cf3 https:// www.esd.whs.mil/Directives/Issuances/dodm \cf4 or see \cf3 11.201\cf4 (d)(2) or (3)). FIPS PUBS may be obtained from the Government Publishing Office (GPO), or the Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service (NTIS) (see address in \cf3 11.201\cf4 (d)(4)).\

\f0\b 11.103 Market acceptance.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 41 U.S.C.3307(e) \cf4 provides that, in accordance with agency procedures, the head of an agency may, under appropriate circumstances, require offerors to demonstrate that the items offered-\

\f1\b0 (i) Achieved commercial market acceptance; or\
(ii) Been satisfactorily supplied to an agency under current or recent contracts for the same or similar requirements; and\
(2) Otherwise meet the item description, specifications, or other criteria prescribed in the public notice and solicitation. (b) Appropriate circumstances may, for example, include situations where the agency\'92s minimum need is for an item that\
has a demonstrated reliability, performance or product support record in a specified environment. Use of market acceptance is inappropriate when new or evolving items may meet the agency\'92s needs.\
(c) In developing criteria for demonstrating that an item has achieved commercial market acceptance, the contracting officer shall ensure the criteria in the solicitation-\
(1) Reflect the minimum need of the agency and are reasonably related to the demonstration of an item\'92s acceptability to meet the agency\'92s minimum need;\
(2) Relate to an item\'92s performance and intended use, not an offeror\'92s capability;\
(3) Are supported by market research;\
(4) Include consideration of items supplied satisfactorily under recent or current Government contracts, for the same or\
similar items; and\
(5) Consider the entire relevant commercial market, including small business concerns.\
(d) Commercial market acceptance shall not be used as a sole criterion to evaluate whether an item meets the Government\'92s requirements.\
(e) When commercial market acceptance is used, the contracting officer shall document the file to- (1) Describe the circumstances justifying the use of commercial market acceptance criteria; and (2) Support the specific criteria being used.\

\f0\b 11.104 Use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) While the use of performance specifications is preferred to encourage offerors to propose innovative solutions, the use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions may be advantageous under certain circumstances.\
(b) Brand name or equal purchase descriptions must include, in addition to the brand name, a general description of those salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the brand name item that an "equal" item must meet to be acceptable for award. Use brand name or equal descriptions when the salient characteristics are firm requirements.\

\f0\b 11.105 Items peculiar to one manufacturer.\

\f1\b0 Agency requirements shall not be written so as to require a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company, unless-\
(a) (1) The particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government\'92s requirements, and market research indicates other companies\'92 similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency\'92s needs;\
(2) (i) The authority to contract without providing for full and open competition is supported by the required justifications and approvals (see \cf3 6.302-1\cf4 ); or\
(ii) The basis for not providing for maximum practicable competition is documented in the file (see \cf3 13.106-1\cf4 (b)) or justified (see \cf3 13.501\cf4 ) when the acquisition is awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.\
(3) The documentation or justification is posted for acquisitions over $25,000. (See \cf3 5.102\cf4 (a)(6).) (b) For multiple award schedule orders, see \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 .\
(c) For orders under indefinite-quantity contracts, see \cf3 16.505\cf4 (a)(4).\

\f0\b 11.106 Purchase descriptions for service contracts.\

\f1\b0 In drafting purchase descriptions for service contracts, agency requiring activities shall ensure that inherently governmental functions (see \cf3 subpart 7.5\cf4 ) are not assigned to a contractor. These purchase descriptions shall-\
(a) Reserve final determination for Government officials;\
(b) Require proper identification of contractor personnel who attend meetings, answer Government telephones, or work in situations where their actions could be construed as acts of Government officials unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves; and\
(c) Require suitable marking of all documents or reports produced by contractors.\

(b) Insert the provision at \cf3 52.211-7\cf4 , Alternatives to Government-Unique Standards, in solicitations that use Government- unique standards when the agency uses the transaction-based reporting method to report its use of voluntary consensus standards to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (see OMB Circular A-119, "Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities"). Use of the provision\
is optional for agencies that report their use of voluntary consensus standards to the National Institute of Standards and Technology using the categorical reporting method. Agencies that manage their specifications on a contract-by-contract basis use the transaction-based method of reporting. Agencies that manage their specifications centrally use the categorical method of reporting. Agency regulations regarding specification management describe which method is used.\

\f1\b0 (a) Solicitations citing requirements documents listed in the General Services Administration (GSA) Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, available on the DoD Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST) website, or listed in other agency index shall identify each document\'92s approval date and the dates of any applicable amendments and revisions. Do not use general identification references, such as "the issue in effect on the date of the solicitation." Contracting offices will not normally furnish these cited documents with the solicitation, except when-\
(1) The requirements document must be furnished with the solicitation to enable prospective contractors to make a competent evaluation of the solicitation;\
(2) In the judgment of the contracting officer, it would be impracticable for prospective contractors to obtain the documents in reasonable time to respond to the solicitation; or\
(3) A prospective contractor requests a copy of a Government promulgated requirements document.\
(b) Contracting offices shall clearly identify in the solicitation any pertinent documents not listed in the GSA Index of\
Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions or ASSIST. Such documents shall be furnished with the solicitation or specific instructions shall be furnished for obtaining or examining such documents.\
(c) When documents refer to other documents, such references shall\'96\
(1) Be restricted to documents, or appropriate portions of documents, that apply in the acquisition; (2) Cite the extent of their applicability;\
(3) Not conflict with other documents and provisions of the solicitation; and\
(4) Identify all applicable first tier references.\

\fs24 Subpart 11.4 - Delivery or Performance Schedules\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) The time of delivery or performance is an essential contract element and shall be clearly stated in solicitations. Contracting officers shall ensure that delivery or performance schedules are realistic and meet the requirements of the acquisition. Schedules that are unnecessarily short or difficult to attain-\
(1) Tend to restrict competition,\
(2) Are inconsistent with small business policies, and (3) May result in higher contract prices.\
(b) Solicitations shall, except when clearly unnecessary, inform bidders or offerors of the basis on which their bids or proposals will be evaluated with respect to time of delivery or performance.\
(c) If timely delivery or performance is unusually important to the Government, liquidated damages clauses may be used (see \cf3 subpart 11.5\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 11.402 Factors to consider in establishing schedules.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Supplies or services. 
\f1\i0 When establishing a contract delivery or performance schedule, consideration shall be given to applicable factors such as the-\
(1) Urgency of need; (2) Industry practices; (3) Market conditions; (4) Transportation time; (5) Production time;\
(6) Capabilities of small business concerns;\
(7) Administrative time for obtaining and evaluating offers and for awarding contracts;\
(8) Time for contractors to comply with any conditions precedent to contract performance; and\
(9) Time for the Government to perform its obligations under the contract; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 furnishing Government property.\
(b) 
\f2\i Construction
\f1\i0 . When scheduling the time for completion of a construction contract, the contracting officer shall consider applicable factors such as the-\
(1) Nature and complexity of the project;\
(2) Construction seasons involved;\
(3) Required completion date;\
(4) Availability of materials and equipment;\
(5) Capacity of the contractor to perform; and\
(6) Use of multiple completion dates. (In any given contract, separate completion dates may be established for\
separable items of work. When multiple completion dates are used, requests for extension of time must be evaluated with respect to each item, and the affected completion dates modified when appropriate.)\

\f0\b 11.403 Supplies or services.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer may express contract delivery or performance schedules in terms of-\
(1) Specific calendar dates;\
(2) Specific periods from the date of the contract; 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 from the date of award or acceptance by the Government, or\
from the date shown as the effective date of the contract;\
(3) Specific periods from the date of receipt by the contractor of the notice of award or acceptance by the Government\
(including notice by receipt of contract document executed by the Government); or\
(4) Specific time for delivery after receipt by the contractor of each individual order issued under the contract, as in\
indefinite delivery type contracts and GSA schedules.\
(b) The time specified for contract performance should not be curtailed to the prejudice of the contractor because of delay\
by the Government in giving notice of award.\
(c) If the delivery schedule is based on the date of the contract, the contracting officer shall mail or otherwise furnish to\
the contractor the contract, notice of award, acceptance of proposal, or other contract document not later than the date of the contract.\
(d) If the delivery schedule is based on the date the contractor receives the notice of award, or if the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates on the assumption that the notice of award will be received by a specified\

\fs20 date, the contracting officer shall send the contract, notice of award, acceptance of proposal, or other contract document by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other method that will provide evidence of the date of receipt.\
(e) In invitations for bids, if the delivery schedule is based on the date of the contract, and a bid offers delivery based on the date the contractor receives the contract or notice of award, the contracting officer shall evaluate the bid by adding 5 calendar days (as representing the normal time for arrival through ordinary mail). If the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically, (1) the solicitation shall so state; and (2) the contracting officer shall evaluate delivery schedule based on the date of contract receipt or notice of award, by adding oneworking day. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If the offered delivery date computed with mailing or transmittal time is later than the delivery date required by the invitation for bids, the bid shall be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If award is made, the delivery date will be the number of days offered in the bid after the contractor actually receives the notice of award.\

\f0\b 11.404 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Supplies or services. (1) The contracting officer may use a time of delivery clause to set forth a required delivery schedule and to allow an offeror to propose an alternative delivery schedule. The clauses and their alternates may be used in solicitations and contracts for other than construction and architect-engineering substantially as shown, or they may be changed or new clauses written.\
(2) The contracting officer may insert in solicitations and contracts other than those for construction and architect- engineering, a clause substantially the same as the clause at \cf3 52.211-8\cf4 , Time of Delivery, if the Government requires delivery by a particular time and the delivery schedule is to be based on the date of the contract. If the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an assumed date of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate I. If the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an assumed date the contractor will receive notice of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate II. If the delivery schedule is to be based on the actual date the contractor receives a written notice of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate III.\
(3) The contracting officer may insert in solicitations and contracts other than those for construction and architect- engineering, a clause substantially the same as the clause at \cf3 52.211-9\cf4 , Desired and Required Time of Delivery, if the Government desires delivery by a certain time but requires delivery by a specified later time, and the delivery schedule is\
to be based on the date of the contract. If the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an assumed date of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate I. If the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an assumed date the contractor will receive notice of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate II. If the delivery schedule is to be based on the actual date the contractor receives a written notice of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate III.\
(b) 
\f2\i Construction
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.211-10\cf4 , Commencement, Prosecution, and Completion of Work, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price construction contract is contemplated. The clause may be changed to accommodate the issuance of orders under indefinite-delivery contracts. If the completion date is expressed\
as a specific calendar date, computed on the basis of the contractor receiving the notice to proceed by a certain day, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate I.\

\fs24 Subpart 11.5 - Liquidated Damages\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for using liquidated damages clauses in solicitations and contracts for supplies, services, research and development, and construction.\
(b) This subpart does not apply to liquidated damages-\
(1) For subcontracting plans (see \cf3 19.705-7\cf4 );\
(2) Related to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute (see \cf3 subpart 22.3\cf4 ); or (3) Related to paid sick leave for Federal contractors (see \cf3 subpart 22.21\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 11.501 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer must consider the potential impact on pricing, competition, and contract administration before using a liquidated damages clause. Use liquidated damages clauses only when-\
(1) The time of delivery or timely performance is so important that the Government may reasonably expect to suffer damage if the delivery or performance is delinquent; and\
(2) The extent or amount of such damage would be difficult or impossible to estimate accurately or prove.\
(b) Liquidated damages are not punitive and are not negative performance incentives (see \cf3 16.402-2\cf4 ). Liquidated damages\
are used to compensate the Government for probable damages. Therefore, the liquidated damages rate must be a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused by late delivery or untimely performance of the particular contract. Use a maximum amount or a maximum period for assessing liquidated damages if these limits reflect the maximum probable damage to the Government. Also, the contracting officer may use more than one liquidated damages rate when the contracting officer expects the probable damage to the Government to change over the contract period of performance.\
(c) The contracting officer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate liquidated damages. If the contract contains a liquidated damages clause and the contracting officer is considering terminating the contract for default, the contracting officer should seek expeditiously to obtain performance by the contractor or terminate the contract and repurchase (see \cf3 subpart 49.4\cf4 ). Prompt contracting officer action will prevent excessive loss to defaulting contractors and protect the interests of the Government.\
(d) The head of the agency may reduce or waive the amount of liquidated damages assessed under a contract, if the Commissioner, Financial Management Service, or designee approves (see Treasury Order 145-10).\

\f0\b 11.502 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Include the applicable liquidated damages clause and liquidated damages rates in solicitations when the contract will contain liquidated damages provisions.\
(b) Construction contracts with liquidated damages provisions must describe the rate(s) of liquidated damages assessed per day of delay. The rate(s) should include the estimated daily cost of Government inspection and superintendence. The rate(s) should also include an amount for other expected expenses associated with delayed completion such as-\
(1) Renting substitute property; or\
(2) Paying additional allowance for living quarters.\

\f0\b 11.503 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Use the clause at \cf3 52.211-11\cf4 , Liquidated Damages-Supplies, Services, or Research and Development, in fixed-price solicitations and contracts for supplies, services, or research and development when the contracting officer determines that liquidated damages are appropriate (see \cf3 11.501\cf4 (a)).\
(b) Use the clause at \cf3 52.211-12\cf4 , Liquidated Damages-Construction, in solicitations and contracts for construction, other than cost-plus-fixed-fee, when the contracting officer determines that liquidated damages are appropriate (see \cf3 11.501\cf4 (a)). If the contract specifies more than one completion date for separate parts or stages of the work, revise paragraph (a) of the clause to state the amount of liquidated damages for delay of each separate part or stage of the work.\
(c) Use the clause at \cf3 52.211-13\cf4 , Time Extensions, in solicitations and contracts for construction that use the clause at \cf3 52.211-12\cf4 , Liquidated Damages-Construction, when that clause has been revised as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.\

\fs24 Subpart 11.6 - Priorities and Allocations\

\fs20 11.600 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart implements the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS), a Department of Commerce regulation in support of approved national defense, emergency preparedness, and energy programs (see 15 CFR part 700).\

\f0\b 11.601 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Approved program 
\f1\i0 means a program determined as necessary or appropriate for priorities and allocations support to promote the national defense by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, or the Secretary of Homeland Security, under the authority of the Defense Production Act, the Stafford Act, and Executive Order 12919, or the Selective Service Act and related statutes and Executive Order 12742.\

\f2\i Delegate Agency 
\f1\i0 means a Government agency authorized by delegation from the Department of Commerce to place priority ratings on contracts or orders needed to support approved programs.\

\f2\i National defense 
\f1\i0 means programs for military and energy production or construction, military assistance to any foreign nation, stockpiling, space, and any directly related activity. Such term includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to title VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( \cf3 42 U.S.C. 5195 
\f2\i \cf4 et seq
\f1\i0 .) and critical infrastructure protection and restoration. ( \cf3 50 U.S.C. App. \'a7 2152\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Rated order 
\f1\i0 means a prime contract, a subcontract, or a purchase order in support of an approved program issued in accordance with the provisions of the DPAS regulation (15 CFR part 700).\

\f0\b 11.602 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Under Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (\cf3 50 U.S.C. App.2061\cf4 , 
\f2\i etseq
\f1\i0 .), the President is authorized to require preferential acceptance and performance of contracts and orders supporting certain approved national defense and energy programs and to allocate materials, services, and facilities in such a manner as to promote these approved programs.\
(b) The President delegated the priorities and allocations authorities of the Defense Production Act in Executive Order 12919. As part of that delegation, the President designated the Secretary of Commerce to administer the DPAS. For more information, check the DPAS website at: \cf3 www.bis.doc.gov/dpas\cf4 .\

\f0\b 11.603 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) There are two levels of priority for rated orders established by the DPAS, identified by the rating symbols "DO" and "DX". All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over DO rated and unrated orders (see 15 CFR 700.11). The DPAS regulation contains provisions concerning the elements of a rated order (see 15 CFR 700.12); acceptance and rejection of rated orders (see 15 CFR 700.13); preferential scheduling (see 15 CFR 700.14); extension of priority ratings (flowdown) (see 15 CFR 700.15); changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders (see 15 CFR 700.16); use of rated orders (see 15 CFR 700.17); and limitations on placing rated orders (see 15 CFR 700.18).\
(b) The Delegate Agencies have been given authority by the Department of Commerce to place rated orders in support of approved programs (see Schedule I of the DPAS). Other U.S. Government agencies, Canada, and foreign nations may apply for priority rating authority.\
(c) Rated orders shall be placed in accordance with the provisions of the DPAS.\
(d) Agency heads shall ensure compliance with the DPAS by contracting activities within their agencies.\
(e) Agency heads shall provide contracting activities with specific guidance on the issuance of rated orders in support of\
approved agency programs, including the general limitations and jurisdictional limitations on placing rated orders (see 15 CFR 700.18 and Executive Order 12919).\
(f) Contracting officers shall follow agency procedural instructions concerning the use of rated orders in support of approved agency programs.\
(g) Contracting officers, contractors, or subcontractors at any tier, that experience difficulty placing rated orders, obtaining timely delivery under rated orders, locating a contractor or supplier to fill a rated order, ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by contractors or suppliers, or require rating authority for items not automatically ratable under the DPAS, should promptly seek special priorities assistance in accordance with agency procedures (see 15 CFR 700.50-700.55 and 700.80).\

\fs24 Subpart 11.7 - Variation in Quantity\

\fs20 11.701 Supply contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) A fixed-price supply contract may authorize Government acceptance of a variation in the quantity of items called for\
if the variation is caused by conditions of loading, shipping, or packing, or by allowances in manufacturing processes. Any permissible variation shall be stated as a percentage and it may be an increase, a decrease, or a combination of both; however, contracts for subsistence items may use other applicable terms of variation in quantity.\
(b) There should be no standard or usual variation percentage. The overrun or underrun permitted in each contract should be based upon the normal commercial practices of a particular industry for a particular item, and the permitted percentage should be no larger than is necessary to afford a contractor reasonable protection. The permissible variation shall not exceed plus or minus 10 percent unless a different limitation is established in agency regulations. Consideration shall be given to the quantity to which the percentage variation applies. For example, when delivery will be made to multiple destinations and it is desired that the quantity variation apply to the item quantity for each destination, this requirement must be stated in the contract.\
(c) Contractors are responsible for delivery of the specified quantity of items in a fixed-price contract, within allowable variations, if any. If a contractor delivers a quantity of items in excess of the contract requirements plus any allowable variation in quantity, particularly small dollar value overshipments, it results in unnecessary administrative costs to the Government in determining disposition of the excess quantity. Accordingly, the contract may include the clause at \cf3 52.211-17\cf4 , Delivery of Excess Quantities, to provide that-\
(1) Excess quantities of items totaling up to $250 in value may be retained without compensating the contractor; and\
(2) Excess quantities of items totaling over $250 in value may, at the Government\'92s option, be either returned at the contractor\'92s expense or retained and paid for at the contract unit price.\

\f0\b 11.702 Construction contracts.\

\f1\b0 Construction contracts may authorize a variation in estimated quantities of unit-priced items. When the variation between the estimated quantity and the actual quantity of a unit-priced item is more than plus or minus 15 percent, an equitable adjustment in the contract price shall be made upon the demand of either the Government or the contractor. The contractor may request an extension of time if the quantity variation is such as to cause an increase in the time necessary for completion. The contracting officer must receive the request in writing within 10 days from the beginning of the period of delay. However, the contracting officer may extend this time limit before the date of final settlement of the contract. The contracting officer shall ascertain the facts and make any adjustment for extending the completion date that the findings justify.\

\f0\b 11.703 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.211-16\cf4 , Variation in Quantity, in solicitations and contracts, if authorizing a variation in quantity in fixed-price contracts for supplies or for services that involve the furnishing of supplies.\
(b) The contracting officer may insert the clause at \cf3 52.211-17\cf4 , Delivery of Excess Quantities, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price supply contract is contemplated.\
(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.211-18\cf4 , Variation in Estimated Quantity, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price construction contract is contemplated that authorizes a variation in the estimated quantity of unit-priced items.\

 12.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures unique to the acquisition of commercial products, including commercial components, and commercial services. It implements the Federal Government\'92s preference for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services contained in \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1906\cf4 ,\cf3 1907\cf4 , and \cf3 3307 \cf4 and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3451-3453 \cf4 by establishing acquisition policies more closely resembling those of the commercial marketplace and encouraging the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.\

\f0\b 12.001 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Subcontract
\f1\i0 , as used in this part, includes, but is not limited to, a transfer of commercial products or commercial services between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 12.1 - Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services\

\fs20 12.101 Policy.\

\f1\b0 The head of the agency shall\'97\
(a) Conduct market research to determine whether commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items are available that could meet the agency\'92s requirements;\
(b) Acquire commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items when they are available to meet the needs of the agency; and\
(c) Require prime contractors and subcontractors at all tiers to incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, commercial products, commercial services, or nondevelopmental items as components of items supplied to the agency.\

\f0\b 12.102 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 (a) This part shall be used for the acquisition of supplies or services that meet the definitions of \'93commercial product\'94 or \'93commercial service\'94 at \cf3 2.101\cf4 .\
(b) Contracting officers shall use the policies in this part in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in \cf3 part 13\cf4 , Simplified Acquisition Procedures; \cf3 part 14\cf4 , Sealed Bidding; or \cf3 part 15\cf4 , Contracting by Negotiation, as appropriate for the particular acquisition.\
(c) Contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services are subject to the policies in other parts of the FAR. When a policy in another part of the FAR is inconsistent with a policy in this part, this \cf3 part 12 \cf4 shall take precedence for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\
(d) The definition of commercial product uses the phrase \'93purposes other than governmental purposes\'94. These purposes are those that are not unique to a government.\
(e) This part shall not apply to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services\'97 (1) At or below the micro-purchase threshold;\
(2) Using the \cf3 Standard Form 44 \cf4 (see \cf3 13.306\cf4 );\
(3) Using the imprest fund (see \cf3 13.305\cf4 );\
(4) Using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of purchase rather than only as a method of payment; or\
(5) Directly from another Federal agency.\
(f) (1) Contracting officers may treat any acquisition of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency,\
are to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack, as an acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\
(2) A contract in an amount greater than $20 million that is awarded on a sole source basis for a product or service treated as a commercial product or commercial service under paragraph (f)(1) of this section but does not meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service as defined at FAR \cf3 2.101 \cf4 shall not be exempt from\'97\
(i) Cost accounting standards (see \cf3 subpart 30.2\cf4 ); or\
(ii) Certified cost or pricing data requirements (see \cf3 15.403\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 12.103 Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items.\

\f1\b0 Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items are defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 . Unless indicated otherwise, all of the policies that apply to commercial products also apply to COTS items. Section \cf3 12.505 \cf4 lists the laws that are not applicable to COTS (in addition to \cf3 12.503 \cf4 and \cf3 12.504\cf4 ).\

\f0\b\fs20 12.201 General.\

\fs24 Subpart 12.2 - Special Requirements for the Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart identifies special requirements for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services intended to more closely resemble those customarily used in the commercial marketplace, as well as other considerations necessary for proper planning, solicitation, evaluation, and award of contracts for commercial products and commercial services.\

\f0\b 12.202 Market research and description of agency need.\

\f1\b0 (a) Market research (see \cf3 10.001\cf4 ) is an essential element of building an effective strategy for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services and establishes the foundation for the agency description of need (see \cf3 part 11\cf4 ), the solicitation, and resulting contract.\
(b) The description of agency need must contain sufficient detail for potential offerors of commercial products or commercial services to know which commercial products or commercial services may be suitable. Generally, for acquisitions in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, an agency\'92s statement of need for a commercial product or commercial service will describe the type of commercial product or commercial service to be acquired and explain how the agency intends to use the product or service in terms of function to be performed, performance requirement or essential physical characteristics. Describing the agency\'92s needs in these terms allows offerors to propose methods that will best meet the needs of the Government.\
(c) Follow the procedures in \cf3 subpart 11.2 \cf4 regarding the identification and availability of specifications, standards and commercial item descriptions.\
(d) Requirements documents shall identify the applicable information and communication technology accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.1 (see \cf3 11.002\cf4 (f) and \cf3 subpart 39.2\cf4 ).\
(e) When acquiring information technology using Internet Protocol, agencies must include the appropriate Internet Protocol compliance requirements in accordance with \cf3 11.002\cf4 (g).\

\f0\b 12.203 Procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers shall use the policies unique to the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services prescribed in this part in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in \cf3 part 13\cf4 , Simplified Acquisition Procedures; \cf3 part 14 \cf4 Sealed Bidding; or \cf3 part 15\cf4 , Contracting by Negotiation, as appropriate for the particular acquisition. The contracting officer may use the streamlined procedure for soliciting offers for commercial product or commercial service prescribed in \cf3 12.603\cf4 . For acquisitions of commercial products or commercial services exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7.5 million ($15 million for acquisitions as described in \cf3 13.500 \cf4 (c)), including options, contracting activities may use any of the simplified procedures authorized by \cf3 subpart 13.5\cf4 .\
(b) Contracting officers shall ensure the criteria at \cf3 15.101-2\cf4 (c) are met when using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.\

\f0\b 12.204 Solicitation/contract form.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The contracting officer shall use the \cf3 Standard Form 1449\cf4 , Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Products and Commercial Services, if\'97\
(i) The acquisition is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold; (ii) A paper solicitation or contract is being issued; and\
(iii) Procedures at \cf3 12.603 \cf4 are not being used.\
(2) Use of the \cf3 SF 1449 \cf4 is nonmandatory but encouraged for commercial acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(b) Consistent with the requirements at \cf3 5.203\cf4 (a) and (h), the contracting officer may allow fewer than 15 days before issuance of the solicitation.\

\f0\b 12.205 Offers.\

\f1\b0 (a) Where technical information is necessary for evaluation of offers, agencies should, as part of market research, review existing literature generally available in the industry to determine its adequacy for purposes of evaluation. If adequate, contracting officers shall request existing product or service literature from offerors of commercial products or commercial services in lieu of unique technical proposals.\

\fs20 (b) Contracting officers should allow offerors to propose multiple offers that will meet a Government need in response to solicitations for commercial products or commercial services. The contracting officer shall evaluate each offer separately.\
(c) Consistent with the requirements at \cf3 5.203\cf4 (b), the contracting officer may allow fewer than 30 days response time for receipt of offers for commercial products or commercial services, unless the acquisition is covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or a Free Trade Agreement (see \cf3 5.203\cf4 (h)).\

\f0\b 12.206 Use of past performance.\

\f1\b0 Past performance should be an important element of every evaluation and contract award for commercial products and commercial services. Contracting officers should consider past performance data from a wide variety of sources both inside and outside the Federal Government in accordance with the policies and procedures contained in \cf3 subpart 9.1\cf4 ,\cf3 13.106\cf4 , or \cf3 subpart 15.3\cf4 , as applicable.\

\f0\b 12.207 Contract type.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, agencies shall use firm-fixed-price contracts or fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\
(b) (1) A time-and-materials contract or labor-hour contract (see \cf3 subpart 16.6\cf4 ) may be used for the acquisition of commercial services when-\
(i) The service is acquired under a contract awarded using-\
(A) Competitive procedures (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , the procedures in \cf3 6.102\cf4 , the set-aside procedures in \cf3 subpart 19.5\cf4 , or\
competition conducted in accordance with \cf3 part 13\cf4 );\
(B) The procedures for other than full and open competition in \cf3 6.3 \cf4 provided the agency receives offers that satisfy\
the Government\'92s expressed requirement from two or more responsible offerors; or\
(C) The fair opportunity procedures in \cf3 16.505 \cf4 (including discretionary small business set-asides under \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)\
(2)(i)(F)), if placing an order under a multiple-award delivery-order contract; and (ii) The contracting officer-\
(A) Executes a determination and findings (D&F) for the contract, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section (but see paragraph (c) of this section for indefinite-delivery contracts), that no other contract type authorized by this subpart is suitable;\
(B) Includes a ceiling price in the contract or order that the contractor exceeds at its own risk; and (C) Prior to increasing the ceiling price of a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract or order, shall-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Conduct an analysis of pricing and other relevant factors to determine if the action is in the best interest of the Government;\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Document the decision in the contract or order file; and 
\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 When making a change that modifies the general scope of-\

\f2\i (i) 
\f1\i0 A contract, follow the procedures at \cf3 6.303\cf4 ;\

\f2\i (ii) 
\f1\i0 An order issued under the Federal Supply Schedules, follow the procedures at \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 ; or\

\f2\i (iii) 
\f1\i0 An order issued under multiple award task and delivery order contracts, follow the procedures at\
\cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(2).\
(2) Each D&F required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify\
that no other contract type authorized by this subpart is suitable. At a minimum, the D&F shall-\
(i) Include a description of the market research conducted (see \cf3 10.002\cf4 (e));\
(ii) Establish that it is not possible at the time of placing the contract or order to accurately estimate the extent or\
duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence;\
(iii) Establish that the requirement has been structured to maximize the use of firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with\
economic price adjustment contracts (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , by limiting the value or length of the time-and-material/labor-hour contract or order; establishing fixed prices for portions of the requirement) on future acquisitions for the same or similar requirements; and\
(iv) Describe actions planned to maximize the use of firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts on future acquisitions for the same requirements.\
(3) See \cf3 16.601\cf4 (d)(1) for additional approval required for contracts expected to extend beyond three years.\
(4) See \cf3 8.404\cf4 (h) for the requirement for determination and findings when using Federal Supply Schedules. (c) (1) Indefinite-delivery contracts (see \cf3 subpart 16.5\cf4 ) may be used when-\
(i) The prices are established based on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment; or 12.2-2\

\f1\b0 (ii) Rates are established for commercial services acquired on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis.\
(2) When an indefinite-delivery contract is awarded with services priced on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis,\
contracting officers shall, to the maximum extent practicable, also structure the contract to allow issuance of orders on a firm- fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis. For such contracts, the contracting officer shall execute\
the D&F required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for each order placed on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis. Placement of orders shall be in accordance with \cf3 subpart 8.4 \cf4 or \cf3 16.5\cf4 , as applicable.\
(3) If an indefinite-delivery contract only allows for the issuance of orders on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis, the D&F required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be executed to support the basic contract and shall also explain why providing for an alternative firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment pricing structure is not practicable. The D&F for this contract shall be approved one level above the contracting officer. Placement of orders shall be in accordance with \cf3 subpart 16.5\cf4 .\
(d) The contract types authorized by this subpart may be used in conjunction with an award fee and performance or delivery incentives when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost (see \cf3 16.202-1 \cf4 and \cf3 16.203-1\cf4 ).\
(e) Use of any contract type other than those authorized by this subpart to acquire commercial products or commercial services is prohibited.\

\f0\b 12.208 Contract quality assurance.\

\f1\b0 Contracts for commercial products shall rely on contractors' existing quality assurance systems as a substitute for Government inspection and testing before tender for acceptance unless customary market practices for the commercial product being acquired include in-process inspection. Any in-process inspection by the Government shall be conducted in a manner consistent with commercial practice. The Government shall rely on the contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that commercial services acquired conform to contract requirements before they are tendered to the Government.\

\f0\b 12.209 Determination of price reasonableness.\

\f1\b0 While the contracting officer must establish price reasonableness in accordance with \cf3 13.106-3\cf4 ,\cf3 14.408-2\cf4 , or \cf3 subpart\
15.4\cf4 , as applicable, the contracting officer should be aware of customary commercial products and commercial services and conditions when pricing commercial products and commercial services. Commercial product and commercial service prices are affected by factors that include, but are not limited to, speed of delivery, length and extent of warranty, limitations of seller\'92s liability, quantities ordered, length of the performance period, and specific performance requirements. The contracting officer must ensure that contract terms, conditions, and prices are commensurate with the Government\'92s need.\

\f0\b 12.210 Contract financing.\

\f1\b0 Customary market practice for some commercial products and commercial services may include buyer contract financing. The contracting officer may offer Government financing in accordance with the policies and procedures in \cf3 part 32\cf4 .\

\f0\b 12.211 Technical data.\

\f1\b0 Except as provided by agency-specific statutes, the Government shall acquire only the technical data and the rights in that data customarily provided to the public with a commercial product or process. The contracting officer shall presume that data delivered under a contract for commercial products was developed exclusively at private expense. When a contract for commercial products requires the delivery of technical data, the contracting officer shall include appropriate provisions and clauses delineating the rights in the technical data in addenda to the solicitation and contract (see \cf3 part 27 \cf4 or agency FAR supplements).\

\f0\b 12.212 Computer software.\

\f1\b0 (a) Commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation shall be acquired under licenses customarily provided to the public to the extent such licenses are consistent with Federal law and otherwise satisfy the Government\'92s needs. Generally, offerors and contractors shall not be required to-\
(1) Furnish technical information related to commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation that is not customarily provided to the public; or\
(2) Relinquish to, or otherwise provide, the Government rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation except as mutually agreed to by the parties.\

\fs20 (b) With regard to commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, the Government shall have only those rights specified in the license contained in any addendum to the contract. For additional guidance regarding the use and negotiation of license agreements for commercial computer software, see \cf3 27.405-3\cf4 .\

\f0\b 12.213 Other commercial practices.\

\f1\b0 It is a common practice in the commercial marketplace for both the buyer and seller to propose terms and conditions written from their particular perspectives. The terms and conditions prescribed in this part seek to balance the interests\
of both the buyer and seller. These terms and conditions are generally appropriate for use in a wide range of acquisitions. However, market research may indicate other commercial practices that are appropriate for the acquisition of the particular item. These practices should be considered for incorporation into the solicitation and contract if the contracting officer determines them appropriate in concluding a business arrangement satisfactory to both parties and not otherwise precluded by law or Executive order.\

\f0\b 12.214 Cost Accounting Standards.\

\f1\b0 Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) do not apply to contracts and subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services when these contracts and subcontracts are firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment (provided that the price adjustment is not based on actual costs incurred). See \cf3 30.201-1 \cf4 for CAS applicability to fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts and subcontracts for commercial products or commercial services when the price adjustment is based on actual costs incurred. When CAS applies, the contracting officer shall insert the appropriate provisions and clauses as prescribed in \cf3 30.201\cf4 .\

\f0\b 12.215 Notification of overpayment.\

\f1\b0 If the contractor notifies the contracting officer of a duplicate payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures at \cf3 32.604\cf4 .\

\f0\b 12.216 Unenforceability of unauthorized obligations.\

\f1\b0 Many supplies or services are acquired subject to supplier license agreements. These are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, but they may apply to any supply or service. For example, computer software and services delivered through the internet (web services) are often subject to license agreements, referred to as End User License Agreements (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Many of these agreements contain indemnification clauses that are inconsistent with Federal law and unenforceable, but which could create a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) if agreed to by the Government. Paragraph (u) of the clause at \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 prevents any such violations.\

Some of the clauses require fill-in; the fill-in language should be inserted as directed by \cf3 52.104\cf4 (d). When cost information is obtained pursuant to \cf3 part 15 \cf4 to establish the reasonableness of prices for commercial products or commercial services, the contracting officer shall insert the clauses prescribed for this purpose in an addendum to the solicitation and contract. This clause may not be tailored.\
(i) Use the clause with its Alternate I when the head of the agency has waived the examination of records by the Comptroller General in accordance with \cf3 25.1001\cf4 .\

(e) 
\f2\i Discretionary use of FAR provisions and clauses. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer may include in solicitations and contracts by addendum other FAR provisions and clauses when their use is consistent with the limitations contained in \cf3 12.302\cf4 . For example:\
(1) The contracting officer may use the provision at \cf3 52.201-1\cf4 , Acquisition 360: Voluntary Survey, as prescribed in \cf3 1.102-3\cf4 (b).\

(3) The contracting officer may include appropriate provisions and clauses when the use of options is in the Government\'92s interest. The provisions and clauses prescribed in \cf3 17.208 \cf4 may be used for this purpose. If the provision at \cf3 52.212-2 \cf4 is used, paragraph (b) provides for the evaluation of options.\
(4) The contracting officer may use the provisions and clauses contained in \cf3 part 23 \cf4 regarding the use of products containing recovered materials and biobased products when appropriate for the item being acquired.\

and clauses) only as necessary to reflect agency unique statutes applicable to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services or as may be approved by the agency senior procurement executive, or the individual responsible for representing the agency on the FAR Council, without power of delegation.\

\f0\b 12.302 Tailoring of provisions and clauses for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . The provisions and clauses established in this subpart are intended to address, to the maximum extent practicable, commercial market practices for a wide range of potential Government acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services. However, because of the broad range of commercial products and commercial services acquired by the Government, variations in commercial practices, and the relative volume of the Government\'92s acquisitions in the specific market, contracting officers may, within the limitations of this subpart, and after conducting appropriate market research,\

(b) 
\f2\i Tailoring 
\f1\i0 \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 , 
\f2\i Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services
\f1\i0 . The following paragraphs of the clause at \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 , Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, implement statutory requirements and shall not be tailored\'97\
(1) Assignments;\
(2) Disputes;\
(3) Payment (except as provided in \cf3 subpart 32.11\cf4 );\
(4) Invoice;\
(5) Other compliances;\
(6) Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts; and (7) Unauthorized obligations.\
(c) 
\f2\i Tailoring inconsistent with customary commercial practice
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall not tailor any clause or otherwise include any additional terms or conditions in a solicitation or contract for commercial products or commercial services in a manner that is inconsistent with customary commercial practice for the item being acquired unless a waiver is approved in accordance with agency procedures. The request for waiver must describe the customary commercial practice found in the marketplace, support the need to include a term or condition that is inconsistent with that practice and include a determination that use of the customary commercial practice is inconsistent with the needs of the Government. A waiver may be requested for an individual or class of contracts for that specific item.\
(d) Tailoring shall be by addenda to the solicitation and contract. The contracting officer shall indicate in Block27 a of the \cf3 SF1449 \cf4 if addenda are attached. These addenda may include, for example, a continuation of the schedule of supplies/services to be acquired from blocks 18 through 21 of the \cf3 SF1449\cf4 ; a continuation of the description of the supplies/services being acquired; further elaboration of any other item(s) on the \cf3 SF1449\cf4 ; any other terms or conditions necessary for the performance of the proposed contract (such as options, ordering procedures for indefinite-delivery type contracts, warranties, contract financing arrangements, etc.).\

\f0\b 12.303 Contract format.\

\f1\b0 Solicitations and contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services prepared using this \cf3 part 12 \cf4 shall be assembled, to the maximum extent practicable, using the following format:\

(b) Continuation of any block from \cf3 SF 1449\cf4 , such as-\
(1) Block 10 if an incentive subcontracting clause is used (the contracting officer shall indicate the applicable percentage);\
(2) Block18 B for remittance address;\
(3) Block19 for line item numbers;\
(4) Block20 for schedule of supplies/services; or (5) Block25 for accounting data;\
(c) Contract clauses-\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 12.4 - Unique Requirements Regarding Terms and Conditions for Commercial Products and Commercial Services\

\fs20 12.401 General.\

\f1\b0 This subpart provides-\

\f0\b 12.403\
 
\f1\b0 (a) Guidance regarding tailoring of the paragraphs in the clause at \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 , Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, when the paragraphs do not reflect the customary practice for a particular market; and\
(b) Guidance on the administration of contracts for commercial products or commercial services in those areas where the terms and conditions in \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 differ substantially from those contained elsewhere in the FAR.\

\f0\b 12.402 Acceptance.\

\f1\b0 (a) The acceptance paragraph in \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 is based upon the assumption that the Government will rely on the contractor\'92s assurances that the commercial product or commercial service tendered for acceptance conforms to the contract requirements. The Government inspection of commercial products or commercial services will not prejudice its other rights under the acceptance paragraph. Additionally, although the paragraph does not address the issue of rejection, the Government always has the right to refuse acceptance of nonconforming items. This paragraph is generally appropriate when the Government is acquiring noncomplex commercial products and commercial services.\
(b) Other acceptance procedures may be more appropriate for the acquisition of complex commercial products or commercial services, or commercial products or commercial services used in critical applications. In such cases, the contracting officer shall include alternative inspection procedure(s) in an addendum and ensure these procedures and the postaward remedies adequately protect the interests of the Government. The contracting officer must carefully examine the terms and conditions of any express warranty with regard to the effect it may have on the Government\'92s available postaward remedies (see \cf3 12.404\cf4 ).\
(c) The acquisition of commercial products or commercial services under other circumstances such as on an "as is" basis may also require acceptance procedures different from those contained in \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 . The contracting officer should consider the effect the specific circumstances will have on the acceptance paragraph as well as other paragraphs of the clause.\

\f0\b 12.403 Termination.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . The clause at \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 permits the Government to terminate a contract for commercial products or commercial services either for the convenience of the Government or for cause. However, the paragraphs in \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 entitled "Termination for the Government\'92s Convenience" and "Termination for Cause" contain concepts which differ from those contained in the termination clauses prescribed in \cf3 part 49\cf4 . Consequently, the requirements of \cf3 part 49 \cf4 do not apply when terminating contracts for commercial products or commercial services and contracting officers shall follow the procedures in this section. Contracting officers may continue to use \cf3 part 49 \cf4 as guidance to the extent that \cf3 part 49 \cf4 does not conflict with this section and the language of the termination paragraphs in \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Policy
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer should exercise the Government\'92s right to terminate a contract for commercial products or commercial services either for convenience or for cause only when such a termination would be in the best interests of the Government. The contracting officer should consult with counsel prior to terminating for cause.\
(c) Termination for cause. (1) The paragraph in \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 entitled "Excusable Delay" requires contractors notify the contracting officer as soon as possible after commencement of any excusable delay. In most situations, this requirement should eliminate the need for a show cause notice prior to terminating a contract. The contracting officer shall send a cure notice prior to terminating a contract for a reason other than late delivery.\
(2) The Government\'92s rights after a termination for cause shall include all the remedies available to any buyer in the marketplace. The Government\'92s preferred remedy will be to acquire similar items from another contractor and to charge the defaulted contractor with any excess reprocurement costs together with any incidental or consequential damages incurred because of the termination.\
(3) When a termination for cause is appropriate, the contracting officer shall send the contractor a written notification regarding the termination. At a minimum, this notification shall-\
(i) Indicate the contract is terminated for cause;\
(ii) Specify the reasons for the termination;\
(iii) Indicate which remedies the Government intends to seek or provide a date by which the Government will\
inform the contractor of the remedy; and\
        12.4-1\

\f1\b0 F
\fs16 EDERAL 
\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (iv) State that the notice constitutes a final decision of the contracting officer and that the contractor has the right to appeal under the Disputes clause (see \cf3 33.211\cf4 ).\
(4) The contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures, shall ensure that information related to termination for cause notices and any amendments are reported. In the event the termination for cause is subsequently converted to a termination for convenience, or is otherwise withdrawn, the contracting officer shall ensure that a notice of the conversion or withdrawal is reported. All reporting shall be in accordance with \cf3 42.1503\cf4 (h).\
(d) Termination for the Government\'92s convenience. (1) When the contracting officer terminates a contract for commercial products or commercial services for the Government\'92s convenience, the contractor shall be paid-\
(i) (A) The percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of the termination for fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts; or\
(B) An amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the Schedule; and\
(ii) Any charges the contractor can demonstrate directly resulted from the termination. The contractor may demonstrate such charges using its standard record keeping system and is not required to comply with the cost accounting standards or the contract cost principles in \cf3 part 31\cf4 . The Government does not have any right to audit the contractor\'92s records solely because of the termination for convenience.\
(2) Generally, the parties should mutually agree upon the requirements of the termination proposal. The parties must balance the Government\'92s need to obtain sufficient documentation to support payment to the contractor against the goal of having a simple and expeditious settlement.\

\f0\b 12.404 Warranties.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Implied warranties
\f1\i0 . The Government\'92s post award rights contained in \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 are the implied warranty of merchantability, the implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose and the remedies contained in the acceptance paragraph.\
(1) The implied warranty of merchantability provides that an item is reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which such items are used. The items must be of at least average, fair or medium-grade quality and must be comparable in quality to those that will pass without objection in the trade or market for items of the same description.\
(2) The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose provides that an item is fit for use for the particular purpose for which the Government will use the items. The Government can rely upon an implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose when-\
(i) The seller knows the particular purpose for which the Government intends to use the item; and\
(ii) The Government relied upon the contractor\'92s skill and judgment that the item would be appropriate for that particular purpose.\
(3) Contracting officers should consult with legal counsel prior to asserting any claim for a breach of an implied warranty.\
(b) 
\f2\i Express warranties
\f1\i0 . \cf3 41 U.S.C.3307(e)(5)(B) \cf4 requires contracting officers to take advantage of commercial warranties. To the maximum extent practicable, solicitations for commercial products shall require offerors to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice. Solicitations may specify minimum warranty terms, such as minimum duration, appropriate for the Government\'92s intended use of the item.\
(1) Any express warranty the Government intends to rely upon must meet the needs of the Government. The contracting officer should analyze any commercial warranty to determine if-\
(i) The warranty is adequate to protect the needs of the Government, 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 items covered by the warranty and length of warranty;\
(ii) The terms allow the Government effective postaward administration of the warranty to include the identification of warranted items, procedures for the return of warranted items to the contractor for repair or replacement, and collection of product performance information; and\
(iii) The warranty is cost-effective.\
(2) In some markets, it may be customary commercial practice for contractors to exclude or limit the implied warranties\
contained in \cf3 52.212-4 \cf4 in the provisions of an express warranty. In such cases, the contracting officer shall ensure that the express warranty provides for the repair or replacement of defective items discovered within a reasonable period of time after acceptance.\
(3) Express warranties shall be included in the contract by addendum (see \cf3 12.302\cf4 ). 12.4-2\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Products and Commercial Services\

\fs20 12.601 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart provides optional procedures for\'97\
(1) Streamlined evaluation of offers for commercial products or commercial services; and\
(2) Streamlined solicitation of offers for commercial products or commercial services for use where appropriate.\

\f0\b 12.603\
 
\f1\b0 (b) These procedures are intended to simplify the process of preparing and issuing solicitations and evaluating offers for commercial products or commercial services consistent with customary commercial practices.\

\f0\b 12.602 Streamlined evaluation of offers.\

\f1\b0 (a) When evaluation factors are used, the contracting officer may insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at \cf3 52.212-2\cf4 , Evaluation-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in solicitations for commercial products or commercial services or comply with the procedures in \cf3 13.106 \cf4 if the acquisition is being made using simplified acquisition procedures. When the provision at \cf3 52.212-2 \cf4 is used, paragraph (a) of the provision shall be tailored to the specific acquisition to describe the evaluation factors and relative importance of those factors. However, when using the simplified acquisition procedures in \cf3 part 13\cf4 , contracting officers are not required to describe the relative importance of evaluation factors.\
(b) Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria contained in the solicitation. For many commercial products or commercial services, the criteria need not be more detailed than technical (capability of the item offered to meet the agency need), price, and past performance. Technical capability may be evaluated by how well the proposed products or services meet the Government requirement instead of predetermined subfactors. Solicitations for commercial products or commercial services do not have to contain subfactors for technical capability when the solicitation adequately describes the intended use of the commercial product or commercial service. A technical evaluation would normally include examination of such things as product or service literature, product samples (if requested), technical features, and warranty provisions. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in section \cf3 13.106 \cf4 or \cf3 subpart 15.3\cf4 , as applicable. The contracting officer shall ensure the instructions provided in the provision at \cf3 52.212-1\cf4 , Instructions to Offerors\'97Commercial Products and Commercial Services, and the evaluation criteria provided in the provision at \cf3 52.212-2\cf4 , Evaluation\'97Commercial Products and Commercial Services, are in agreement.\
(c) Select the offer that is most advantageous to the Government based on the factors contained in the solicitation. Fully document the rationale for selection of the successful offeror including discussion of any trade-offs considered.\

\f0\b 12.603 Streamlined solicitation for commercial products or commercial services.\

\f1\b0 (a) When a written solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the following procedure to reduce the time required to solicit and award contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services. This procedure combines the synopsis required by \cf3 5.203 \cf4 and the issuance of the solicitation into a single document.\
(b) When using the combined synopsis/solicitation procedure, the \cf3 SF1449 \cf4 is not used for issuing the solicitation. (c) To use these procedures, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Prepare the synopsis as described at \cf3 5.207\cf4 .\
(2) In the Description, include the following additional information:\
(i) The following statement:\
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial products or commercial services prepared in accordance with the\
format in \cf3 subpart 12.6\cf4 , as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.\
(ii) The solicitation number and a statement that the solicitation is issued as an invitation to bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ) or request for proposal (RFP).\
(iii) A statement that the solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular _____.\
(iv) A notice regarding any set-aside and the associated NAICS code and small business size standard.\
(v) A list of line item number(s) and items, quantities, and units of measure (including option(s), if applicable). (vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired.\
(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point.\
(viii) A statement that the provision at \cf3 52.212-1\cf4 , Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Products and Commercial\
Services, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the provision.\

If this provision is not used, describe the evaluation procedures to be used.\
(x) A statement advising offerors to include a completed copy of the provision at \cf3 52.212-3\cf4 , Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, with its offer.\
(xi) A statement that the clause at \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 , Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the clause.\
(xii) A statement that the clause at \cf3 52.212-5\cf4 , Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding which, if any, of the additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to the acquisition.\
(xiii) A statement regarding any additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions (such as contract financing arrangements or warranty requirements) determined by the contracting officer to be necessary for this acquisition and consistent with customary commercial practices.\
(xiv) A statement regarding the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating, if applicable. (xv) The date, time and place offers are due.\
(xvi) The name and telephone number of the individual to contact for information regarding the solicitation.\
(3) Allow response time for receipt of offers as follows:\
(i) Because the synopsis and solicitation are contained in a single document, it is not necessary to publicize a\
separate synopsis 15 days before the issuance of the solicitation.\
(ii) When using the combined synopsis and solicitation, contracting officers must establish a response time in\
accordance with \cf3 5.203\cf4 (b) (but see \cf3 5.203\cf4 (h)).\
(4) Publicize amendments to solicitations in the same manner as the initial synopsis and solicitation.\

\f0\b\fs20 13.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, research and development, commercial products, and commercial services, the aggregate amount of which does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ). \cf3 subpart 13.5 \cf4 provides special authority for acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7.5 million ($15 million for acquisitions as described in \cf3 13.500 \cf4 (c)), including options. See \cf3 part 12 \cf4 for policies applicable to the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. See \cf3 36.602-5 \cf4 for simplified procedures to be used when acquiring architect-engineer services.\

\f0\b 13.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Authorized individual 
\f1\i0 means a person who has been granted authority, in accordance with agency procedures, to acquire supplies and services in accordance with this part.\

\f2\i Governmentwide commercial purchase card 
\f1\i0 means a purchase card, similar in nature to a commercial credit card, issued to authorized agency personnel to use to acquire and to pay for supplies and services.\

\f2\i Imprest fund 
\f1\i0 means a cash fund of a fixed amount established by an advance of funds, without charge to an appropriation, from an agency finance or disbursing officer to a duly appointed cashier, for disbursement as needed from time to time in making payment in cash for relatively small amounts.\

\f2\i Third party draft 
\f1\i0 means an agency bank draft, similar to a check, that is used to acquire and to pay for supplies and services. (See Treasury Financial Management Manual, Section 3040.70.)\

\f0\b 13.002 Purpose.\

\f1\b0 The purpose of this part is to prescribe simplified acquisition procedures in order to-\
(a) Reduce administrative costs;\
(b) Improve opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled\
veteran-owned small business concerns to obtain a fair proportion of Government contracts; (c) Promote efficiency and economy in contracting; and\
(d) Avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors.\

\f0\b 13.003 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall use simplified acquisition procedures to the maximum extent practicable for all purchases of supplies or services not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (including purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold). This policy does not apply if an agency can meet its requirement using-\
(1) Required sources of supply under \cf3 part 8 \cf4 (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 Federal Prison Industries, Committee for Purchase from People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled, and Federal Supply Schedule contracts);\
(2) Existing indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts; or\
(3) Other established contracts.\
(b) (1) Acquisitions of supplies or services that have an anticipated dollar value above the micro-purchase threshold,\
but at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, shall be set aside for small business concerns (see \cf3 19.000\cf4 , \cf3 19.203\cf4 , and subpart \cf3 19.5\cf4 ).\
(2) The contracting officer may make an award to a small business concern under the-\
(i) 8(a) Program (see subpart \cf3 19.8\cf4 );\
(ii) Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program (but see \cf3 19.1305 \cf4 );\
(iii) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Program (see subpart \cf3 19.14\cf4 ); or (iv) Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program (see \cf3 subpart 19.15\cf4 ).\
(3) The following contracting officer\'92s decisions for acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold are not subject to review under subpart \cf3 19.4\cf4 :\
(i) A decision not to make an award under the 8(a) Program.\
(ii) A decision not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone small business concerns, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, or EDWOSB concerns and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.\
(4) Each written solicitation under a set-aside shall contain the appropriate provisions prescribed by part \cf3 19\cf4 . If the solicitation is oral, however, information substantially identical to that in the provision shall be given to potential quoters.\

\fs20 (c) (1) The contracting officer shall not use simplified acquisition procedures to acquire supplies and services if the anticipated award will exceed-\
(i) The simplified acquisition threshold; or\
(ii) $7.5 million ($15 million for acquisitions as described in \cf3 13.500\cf4 (c)), including options, for acquisitions of commercial products or commercial services using subpart \cf3 13.5\cf4 .\
(2) Do not break down requirements aggregating more than the simplified acquisition threshold (or for commercial products and commercial services, the threshold in subpart \cf3 13.5\cf4 ) or the micro-purchase threshold into several purchases that are less than the applicable threshold merely to-\
(i) Permit use of simplified acquisition procedures; or\
(ii) Avoid any requirement that applies to purchases exceeding the micro-purchase threshold.\
(d) An agency that has specific statutory authority to acquire personal services (see \cf3 37.104\cf4 ) may use simplified acquisition\
procedures to acquire those services.\
(e) Agencies shall use the Governmentwide commercial purchase card and electronic purchasing techniques to the\
maximum extent practicable in conducting simplified acquisitions (but see \cf3 32.1108\cf4 (b)(2)).\
(f) Agencies shall maximize the use of electronic commerce when practicable and cost-effective (see \cf3 subpart 4.5\cf4 ).\
Drawings and lengthy specifications can be provided off-line in hard copy or through other appropriate means.\
(g) Authorized individuals shall make purchases in the simplified manner that is most suitable, efficient, and economical\
based on the circumstances of each acquisition. For acquisitions not expected to exceed-\
(1) The simplified acquisition threshold when acquiring other than commercial products or commercial services,\
use any appropriate combination of the procedures in \cf3 parts 13\cf4 , \cf3 14\cf4 , \cf3 15\cf4 , \cf3 35\cf4 , or \cf3 36\cf4 , including the use of \cf3 Standard Form1442\cf4 , Solicitation, Offer, and Award (Construction, Alteration, or Repair), for construction contracts (see \cf3 36.701\cf4 (a)); or\
(2) $7.5 million ($15 million for acquisitions as described in \cf3 13.500\cf4 (c)), for commercial products or commercial services, use any appropriate combination of the procedures in parts \cf3 12\cf4 , \cf3 13\cf4 , \cf3 14\cf4 , and \cf3 15 \cf4 (see paragraph (d) of this section).\
(h) In addition to other considerations, contracting officers shall-\
(1) Promote competition to the maximum extent practicable (see \cf3 13.104\cf4 );\
(2) Establish deadlines for the submission of responses to solicitations that afford suppliers a reasonable opportunity to\
respond (see \cf3 5.203\cf4 );\
(3) Consider all quotations or offers that are timely received. For evaluation of quotations or offers received\
electronically, see \cf3 13.106-2\cf4 (b)(4); and\
(4) Use innovative approaches, to the maximum extent practicable, in awarding contracts using simplified acquisition\
procedures.\

\f0\b 13.004 Legal effect of quotations.\

\f1\b0 (a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier\'92s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.\
(b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at \cf3 2.101\cf4 . In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.\
(c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See \cf3 13.302-4 \cf4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)\

\f0\b 13.005 List of laws inapplicable to contracts and subcontracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.\

\f1\b0 (a) The following laws are inapplicable to all contracts and subcontracts (if otherwise applicable to subcontracts) at or below the simplified acquisition threshold pursuant to \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1905\cf4 :\

The FAR Council may make exceptions when it determines in writing that it is in the best interest of the Government that the enactment should apply to contracts or subcontracts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(c) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to laws that-\
(1) Provide for criminal or civil penalties; or\
(2) Specifically state that notwithstanding the language of \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1905\cf4 , the enactment will be applicable to contracts\
or subcontracts in amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(d) Any individual may petition the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), to include any\
applicable provision of law not included on the list set forth in paragraph (a) of this section unless the FAR Council has already determined in writing that the law is applicable. The Administrator, OFPP, will include the law on the list in paragraph (a) of this section unless the FAR Council makes a determination that it is applicable within 60 days of receiving the petition.\

(3) Make maximum effort to obtain trade and prompt payment discounts (see \cf3 14.408-3\cf4 ). Prompt payment discounts\
shall not be considered in the evaluation of quotations; and\
(4) Use bulk funding to the maximum extent practicable. Bulk funding is a system whereby the contracting officer\
receives authorization from a fiscal and accounting officer to obligate funds on purchase documents against a specified lump sum of funds reserved for the purpose for a specified period of time rather than obtaining individual obligational authority on each purchase document. Bulk funding is particularly appropriate if numerous purchases using the same type of funds are to be made during a given period.\

\f0\b\fs20 13.102 Source list.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers should use the System for Award Management (see subpart \cf3 4.11\cf4 ) via \cf3 https://www.sam.gov \cf4 as their primary sources of vendor information. Offices maintaining additional vendor source files or listings should identify the status of each source (when the status is made known to the contracting office) in the following categories:\
(1) Small business.\
(2) Small disadvantaged business.\
(3) Women-owned small business concern, including economically disadvantaged women-owned small business\
concerns and women-owned small business concerns eligible under the Women-owned Small Business (WOSB) Program. (4) HUBZone small business.\
(5) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business.\
(6) Veteran-owned small business.\
(b) The status information may be used as the basis to ensure that small business concerns are provided the maximum practicable opportunities to respond to solicitations issued using simplified acquisition procedures.\

\f0\b 13.103 Use of standing price quotations.\

\f1\b0 Authorized individuals do not have to obtain individual quotations for each purchase. Standing price quotations may be used if-\
(a) The pricing information is current; and\
(b) The Government obtains the benefit of maximum discounts before award.\

\f0\b 13.104 Promoting competition.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase.\
(a) The contracting officer must not-\
(1) Solicit quotations based on personal preference; or\
(2) Restrict solicitation to suppliers of well-known and widely distributed makes or brands.\
(b) If using simplified acquisition procedures and not providing access to the notice of proposed contract action and solicitation information through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE), maximum practicable competition ordinarily\
can be obtained by soliciting quotations or offers from sources within the local trade area. Unless the contract action requires synopsis pursuant to \cf3 5.101 \cf4 and an exception under \cf3 5.202 \cf4 is not applicable, consider solicitation of at least three sources to promote competition to the maximum extent practicable. Whenever practicable, request quotations or offers from two sources not included in the previous solicitation.\

\f0\b 13.105 Synopsis and posting requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer must comply with the public display and synopsis requirements of \cf3 5.101 \cf4 and \cf3 5.203 \cf4 unless an exception in \cf3 5.202 \cf4 applies.\
(b) When acquiring commercial products or commercial services, or supplies or services procured in accordance with \cf3 12.102\cf4 (f)(1), the contracting officer may use a combined synopsis and solicitation. In these cases, a separate solicitation is not required. The contracting officer must include enough information to permit suppliers to develop quotations or offers.\
(c) See \cf3 5.102\cf4 (a)(6) for the requirement to post a brand name justification or documentation required by \cf3 13.106-1\cf4 (b) or \cf3 13.501\cf4 .\
(d) When publicizing contract actions funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5):\
(1) Notices of proposed contract actions shall follow the procedures in \cf3 5.704 \cf4 for posting orders. (2) Award notices shall follow the procedures in \cf3 5.705\cf4 .\

\f0\b 13.106 Soliciting competition, evaluation of quotations or offers, award and documentation.\
13.106-1 Soliciting competition.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Considerations. 
\f1\i0 In soliciting competition, the contracting officer shall consider the guidance in \cf3 13.104 \cf4 and the following before requesting quotations or offers:\
(1) (i) The nature of the article or service to be purchased and whether it is highly competitive and readily available in several makes or brands, or is relatively noncompetitive.\
  -4\
\cf2 (ii) An electronic commerce method that employs widespread electronic public notice is not available; and (iii) The urgency of the proposed purchase.\
(iv) The dollar value of the proposed purchase.\
(v) Past experience concerning specific dealers\'92 prices.\
(2) (i) When soliciting quotations or offers, the contracting officer shall notify potential quoters or offerors of the basis on which award will be made (price alone or price and other factors, 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , past performance and quality).\
(ii) Contracting officers are encouraged to use best value.\
(iii) Solicitations are not required to state the relative importance assigned to each evaluation factor and subfactor, nor are they required to include subfactors.\
(iv) In accordance with \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(c)\cf4 , for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard\'97\
(A) The contracting officer may choose not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for award when a\
solicitation\'97\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Has an estimated value above the simplified acquisition threshold;\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Will result in multiple-award contracts (see subpart \cf3 16.5\cf4 ) that are for the same or similar services; and 
\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 States that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors (see 2.101).\
(B) If the contracting officer chooses not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for the contract award, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each order placed under the contract.\
(C) The exception in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section shall not apply to solicitations for multiple-award contracts that provide for sole source orders pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 637\cf4 (a)).\
(v) Except for DoD, contracting officers shall ensure the criteria at \cf3 15.101-2\cf4 (c)(1)-(5) are met when using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.\
(vi) Except for DoD, avoid using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire certain supplies and services in accordance with \cf3 15.101-2\cf4 (d).\
(b) Soliciting from a single source. (1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. (i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).\
(ii) Where a single source is identified to provide a portion of a purchase because that portion of the purchase specifies a particular brand-name item, the documentation in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section only applies to the portion of the purchase requiring the brand-name item. The documentation should state it is covering only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name.\
(2) 
\f2\i For purchases exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold
\f1\i0 . The requirements at \cf3 13.501\cf4 (a) apply to sole-source (including brand-name) acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services conducted pursuant to subpart \cf3 13.5\cf4 .\
(3) See \cf3 5.102\cf4 (a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand-name justification or documentation.\
(c) Soliciting orally. (1) The contracting officer shall solicit quotations orally to the maximum extent practicable, if-\
(i) The acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold;\
(ii) Oral solicitation is more efficient than soliciting through available electronic commerce alternatives; and (iii) Notice is not required under \cf3 5.101\cf4 .\
(2) However, an oral solicitation may not be practicable for contract actions exceeding $25,000 unless covered by an exception in \cf3 5.202\cf4 .\
(d) 
\f2\i Written solicitations. 
\f1\i0 If obtaining electronic or oral quotations is uneconomical or impracticable, the contracting officer should issue paper solicitations for contract actions likely to exceed $25,000. The contracting officer shall issue a written solicitation for construction requirements exceeding $2,000.\
(e) 
\f2\i Use of options. 
\f1\i0 Options may be included in solicitations, provided the requirements of subpart \cf3 17.2 \cf4 are met and the aggregate value of the acquisition and all options does not exceed the dollar threshold for use of simplified acquisition procedures.\
(f) 
\f2\i Inquiries. 
\f1\i0 An agency should respond to inquiries received through any medium (including electronic commerce) if doing so would not interfere with the efficient conduct of the acquisition.\

\f0\b 13.106-2 Evaluation of quotations or offers.\

\f1\b0 (a) General. (1) The contracting officer shall evaluate quotations or offers-\
(i) In an impartial manner; and\
(ii) Inclusive of transportation charges from the shipping point of the supplier to the delivery destination.\

\fs20 (2) Quotations or offers shall be evaluated on the basis established in the solicitation.\
(3) All quotations or offers shall be considered (see paragraph (b) of this subsection).\
(b) Evaluation procedures. (1) The contracting officer has broad discretion in fashioning suitable evaluation procedures.\
The procedures prescribed in \cf3 parts 14 \cf4 and \cf3 15 \cf4 are not mandatory. At the contracting officer\'92s discretion, one or more, but not necessarily all, of the evaluation procedures in \cf3 part 14 \cf4 or \cf3 15 \cf4 may be used.\
(2) If telecommuting is not prohibited, agencies shall not unfavorably evaluate an offer because it includes telecommuting unless the contracting officer executes a written determination in accordance with FAR \cf3 7.108\cf4 (b).\
(3) If using price and other factors, ensure that quotations or offers can be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion. Formal evaluation plans and establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations or offers are not required. Contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance-\
(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and (ii) May be based on one or more of the following:\
(A) The contracting officer\'92s knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired; (B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;\
(C) The Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) at \cf3 https://www.cpars.gov\cf4 ; or\
(D) Any other reasonable basis.\
(4) For acquisitions conducted using a method that permits electronic response to the solicitation, the contracting officer may-\
(i) After preliminary consideration of all quotations or offers, identify from all quotations or offers received one that is suitable to the user, such as the lowest priced brand name product, and quickly screen all lower priced quotations or offers based on readily discernible value indicators, such as past performance, warranty conditions, and maintenance availability; or\
(ii) Where an evaluation is based only on price and past performance, make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations or offers having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best value when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer.\

\f0\b 13.106-3 Award and documentation.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Basis for award. 
\f1\i0 Before making award, the contracting officer must determine that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.\
(1) Whenever possible, base price reasonableness on competitive quotations or offers.\
(2) If only one response is received, include a statement of price reasonableness in the contract file. The contracting officer may base the statement on-\
(i) Market research;\
(ii) Comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases;\
(iii) Current price lists, catalogs, or advertisements. However, inclusion of a price in a price list, catalog, or\
advertisement does not, in and of itself, establish fairness and reasonableness of the price; (iv) A comparison with similar items in a related industry;\
(v) The contracting officer\'92s personal knowledge of the item being purchased; (vi) Comparison to an independent Government estimate; or\
(vii) Any other reasonable basis.\
(3) Occasionally an item can be obtained only from a supplier that quotes a minimum order price or quantity that either\
unreasonably exceeds stated quantity requirements or results in an unreasonable price for the quantity required. In these instances, the contracting officer should inform the requiring activity of all facts regarding the quotation or offer and ask it to confirm or alter its requirement. The file shall be documented to support the final action taken.\
(b) 
\f2\i File documentation and retention. 
\f1\i0 Keep documentation to a minimum. Purchasing offices shall retain data supporting purchases (paper or electronic) to the minimum extent and duration necessary for management review purposes (see \cf3 subpart 4.8\cf4 ). The following illustrate the extent to which quotation or offer information should be recorded:\
(1) 
\f2\i Oral solicitations. 
\f1\i0 The contracting office should establish and maintain records of oral price quotations in order to reflect clearly the propriety of placing the order at the price paid with the supplier concerned. In most cases, this will consist merely of showing the names of the suppliers contacted and the prices and other terms and conditions quoted by each.\
(2) 
\f2\i Written solicitations 
\f1\i0 (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ). For acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, limit written records of solicitations or offers to notes or abstracts to show prices, delivery, references to printed price lists used, the supplier or suppliers contacted, and other pertinent data.\
   -6\

\f0\b \cf2 13.106-3\
 
\f1\b0 (3) 
\f2\i Special situations. 
\f1\i0 Include additional statements, when applicable\'97\
(i) Explaining the absence of competition (see \cf3 13.106-1 \cf4 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited\
and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source);\
(ii) Supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier; and\
(iii) Except for DoD, when using lowest price technically acceptable source selection process, justifying the use of such process.\
(c) 
\f2\i Notification. 
\f1\i0 For acquisitions that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and for which automatic notification is not provided through an electronic commerce method that employs widespread electronic public notice, notification to unsuccessful suppliers shall be given only if requested or required by \cf3 5.301\cf4 .\
(d) 
\f2\i Request for information. 
\f1\i0 If a supplier requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision shall be provided (see \cf3 15.503\cf4 (b)(2)).\
(e) 
\f2\i Taxpayer Identification Number
\f1\i0 . If an oral solicitation is used, the contracting officer shall ensure that the copy of the award document sent to the payment office is annotated with the contractor\'92s Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and type of organization (see \cf3 4.203\cf4 ), unless this information will be obtained from some other source (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 centralized database). The contracting officer shall disclose to the contractor that the TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the contractor\'92s relationship with the Government (\cf3 31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)\cf4 ).\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 13.2 - Actions At or Below the Micro-Purchase Threshold\

\fs20 13.201 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agency heads are encouraged to delegate micro-purchase authority (see \cf3 1.603-3\cf4 ).\
(b) The Governmentwide commercial purchase card shall be the preferred method to purchase and to pay for micro- purchases (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ).\

\f0\b \cf2 13.202\
 
\f1\b0 \cf4  (c) Purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold may be conducted using any of the methods described in subpart \cf3 13.3\cf4 , provided the purchaser is authorized and trained, pursuant to agency procedures, to use those methods.\
(d) Micro-purchases do not require provisions or clauses, except as provided at \cf3 13.202 \cf4 and \cf3 32.1110\cf4 . This paragraph takes precedence over any other FAR requirement to the contrary, but does not prohibit the use of any clause.\
(e) The requirements in part 8 apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold.\
(f) The procurement requirements in \cf3 subpart 23.1 \cf4 apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold.\
(g) (1) For acquisitions of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used to support\
a contingency operation; to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack; to support a request from the Secretary of State or the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to facilitate provision of international disaster assistance pursuant to \cf3 22 U.S.C. 2292 \cf4 et seq; or to support response to an emergency or major disaster (\cf3 42 U.S.C. 5122\cf4 ), the micro-purchase threshold is\'97\
(i) $20,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, inside the United States; and\
(ii) $35,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States.\
(2) Purchases using this authority must have a clear and direct relationship to the support of a contingency operation; or the defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack; international disaster assistance; or an emergency or major disaster.\
(h) When using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment, purchases at or below the micro- purchase threshold are exempt from verification in the System for Award Management as to whether the contractor has a delinquent debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP).\
(i) Do not purchase any hardware, software, or services developed or provided by Kaspersky Lab that the Government will use on or after October 1, 2018. (See \cf3 4.2002\cf4 ).\
(j) (1) On or after August 13, 2019, do not procure or obtain, or extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain, any equipment, system, or service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system, unless an exception applies or a waiver is granted. (See subpart \cf3 4.21\cf4 .)\
(2) On or after August 13, 2020, agencies are prohibited from entering into a contract, or extending or renewing a contract, with an entity that uses any equipment, system, or service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system, unless an exception applies or a waiver is granted (see subpart \cf3 4.21\cf4 ). This prohibition applies to the use of covered telecommunications equipment or services, regardless of whether that use is in performance of work under a Federal contract.\
(k) The prohibition in \cf3 subpart 4.22 \cf4 on use of a covered application (\'93TikTok\'94) applies to purchases at or below the micro- purchase threshold where the performance of the contract may require the presence or use of a covered application, (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , where social media advertising services might be part of the procurement), unless an exception is granted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-23-13 (see \cf3 4.2202\cf4 ).\
(l) Do not procure or obtain, or extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain, any covered article, or any products or services produced or provided by a source, including contractor use of covered articles or sources, if prohibited from doing so by an applicable Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act (FASCSA) order issued by the Director of National Intelligence, Secretary of Defense, or Secretary of Homeland Security (see \cf3 4.2303\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 13.202 Unenforceability of unauthorized obligations in micro-purchases.\

\f1\b0 Many supplies or services are acquired subject to supplier license agreements. These are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, but they may apply to any supply or service. For example, computer software and services delivered through the internet (web services) are often subject to license agreements, referred to as End User License Agreements (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Many of these agreements contain indemnification clauses that are inconsistent with Federal law and unenforceable, but which could create a violation\

\fs20 of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) if agreed to by the Government. The clause at \cf3 52.232-39\cf4 , Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations, automatically applies to any micro-purchase, including those made with the Governmentwide purchase card. This clause prevents such violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341).\

\f0\b 13.203 Purchase guidelines.\

\f1\b0 (a) Solicitation, evaluation of quotations, and award. (1) To the extent practicable, micro-purchases shall be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers.\
(2) Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotations if the contracting officer or individual appointed in accordance with \cf3 1.603-3\cf4 (b) considers the price to be reasonable.\
(3) The administrative cost of verifying the reasonableness of the price for purchases may more than offset potential savings from detecting instances of overpricing. Therefore, action to verify price reasonableness need only be taken if-\
(i) The contracting officer or individual appointed in accordance with \cf3 1.603-3\cf4 (b) suspects or has information to indicate that the price may not be reasonable (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 comparison to the previous price paid or personal knowledge of the supply or service); or\
(ii) Purchasing a supply or service for which no comparable pricing information is readily available (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 a supply or service that is not the same as, or is not similar to, other supplies or services that have recently been purchased on a competitive basis).\
(b) 
\f2\i Documentation. 
\f1\i0 If competitive quotations were solicited and award was made to other than the low quoter, documentation to support the purchase may be limited to identification of the solicited concerns and an explanation for the award decision.\

\fs20 13.301 Governmentwide commercial purchase card.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in \cf3 32.1108\cf4 (b)(2), the Governmentwide commercial purchase card is authorized for use in making and/or paying for purchases of supplies, services, or construction. The Governmentwide commercial purchase card may be used by contracting officers and other individuals designated in accordance with \cf3 1.603-3\cf4 . The card may be used only for purchases that are otherwise authorized by law or regulation.\
(b) Agencies using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card shall establish procedures for use and control of the card that comply with the Treasury Financial Manual for Guidance of Departments and Agencies (TFM 4-4500) and that are consistent with the terms and conditions of the current GSA credit card contract. Agency procedures should not limit the use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card to micro-purchases. Agency procedures should encourage use of the card in greater dollar amounts by contracting officers to place orders and to pay for purchases against contracts established under \cf3 part 8 \cf4 procedures, when authorized; and to place orders and/or make payment under other contractual instruments, when agreed to by the contractor. See \cf3 32.1110\cf4 (d) for instructions for use of the appropriate clause when payment under a written contract will be made through use of the card.\
(c) The Governmentwide commercial purchase card may be used to-\
(1) Make micro-purchases;\
(2) Place a task or delivery order (if authorized in the basic contract, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase\
agreement); or\
(3) Make payments, when the contractor agrees to accept payment by the card (but see \cf3 32.1108\cf4 (b)(2)).\

\f0\b 13.302 Purchase orders.\
13.302-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided under the unpriced purchase order method (see \cf3 13.302-2\cf4 ), purchase orders generally are issued on a fixed-price basis. See \cf3 12.207 \cf4 for acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.\
(b) Purchase orders shall-\
(1) Specify the quantity of supplies or scope of services ordered;\
(2) Contain a determinable date by which delivery of the supplies or performance of the services is required;\
(3) Provide for inspection as prescribed in \cf3 part 46\cf4 . Generally, inspection and acceptance should be at destination.\
Source inspection should be specified only if required by \cf3 part 46\cf4 . When inspection and acceptance will be performed at destination, advance copies of the purchase order or equivalent notice shall be furnished to the consignee(s) for material receipt purposes. Receiving reports shall be accomplished immediately upon receipt and acceptance of supplies;\
(4) Specify f.o.b. destination for supplies to be delivered within the United States, except Alaska or Hawaii, unless there are valid reasons to the contrary; and\
(5) Include any trade and prompt payment discounts that are offered, consistent with the applicable principles at \cf3 14.408-3\cf4 .\
(c) The contracting officer\'92s signature on purchase orders shall be in accordance with \cf3 4.101 \cf4 and the definitions at \cf3 2.101\cf4 . Facsimile and electronic signature may be used in the production of purchase orders by automated methods.\
(d) Limit the distribution of copies of purchase orders and related forms to the minimum deemed essential for administration and transmission of contractual information.\
(e) In accordance with \cf3 31 U.S.C.3332\cf4 , electronic funds transfer (EFT) is required for payments except as provided in \cf3 32.1110\cf4 . See \cf3 subpart 32.11 \cf4 for instructions for use of the appropriate clause in purchase orders. When obtaining oral quotes, the contracting officer shall inform the quoter of the EFT clause that will be in any resulting purchase order.\

\f0\b 13.302-2 Unpriced purchase orders.\

\f1\b0 (a) An unpriced purchase order is an order for supplies or services, the price of which is not established at the time of issuance of the order.\
(b) An unpriced purchase order may be used only when-\
(1) It is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the purchase order; and (2) The purchase is for-\
(i) Repairs to equipment requiring disassembly to determine the nature and extent of repairs; (ii) Material available from only one source and for which cost cannot readily be established; or\

\fs20 (iii) Supplies or services for which prices are known to be competitive, but exact prices are not known (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 miscellaneous repair parts, maintenance agreements).\
(c) Unpriced purchase orders may be issued on paper or electronically. A realistic monetary limitation, either for each line item or for the total order, shall be placed on each unpriced purchase order. The monetary limitation shall be an obligation subject to adjustment when the firm price is established. The contracting office shall follow up on each order to ensure timely pricing. The contracting officer or the contracting officer\'92s designated representative shall review the invoice price and, if reasonable (see \cf3 13.106-3\cf4 (a)), process the invoice for payment.\

\f0\b 13.302-3 Obtaining contractor acceptance and modifying purchase orders.\

\f1\b0 (a) When it is desired to consummate a binding contract between the parties before the contractor undertakes performance, the contracting officer shall require written (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) acceptance of the purchase order by the contractor.\
(b) Each purchase order modification shall identify the order it modifies and shall contain an appropriate modification number.\
(c) A contractor\'92s written acceptance of a purchase order modification may be required only if-\
(1) Determined by the contracting officer to be necessary to ensure the contractor\'92s compliance with the purchase order\
as revised; or\
(2) Required by agency regulations.\

\f0\b 13.302-4 Termination or cancellation of purchase orders.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a purchase order that has been accepted in writing by the contractor is to be terminated, the contracting officer shall process the termination in accordance with-\
(1) \cf3 12.403 \cf4 and \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 (l) or (m) for commercial products and commercial services; or\
(2) \cf3 part 49 \cf4 or \cf3 52.213-4 \cf4 for other than commercial products or commercial services.\
(b) If a purchase order that has not been accepted in writing by the contractor is to be canceled, the contracting officer\
shall notify the contractor in writing that the purchase order has been canceled, request the contractor\'92s written acceptance of the cancellation, and proceed as follows:\
(1) If the contractor accepts the cancellation and does not claim that costs were incurred as a result of beginning performance under the purchase order, no further action is required (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 the purchase order shall be considered canceled).\
(2) If the contractor does not accept the cancellation or claims that costs were incurred as a result of beginning performance under the purchase order, the contracting officer shall process the action as a termination prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subsection.\

\f0\b 13.302-5 Clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Each purchase order (and each purchase order modification (see \cf3 13.302-3\cf4 )) shall incorporate all clauses prescribed for the particular acquisition.\
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.213-2\cf4 , Invoices, in purchase orders that authorize advance payments (see \cf3 31 U.S.C.3324(d)(2)\cf4 ) for subscriptions or other charges for newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or other publications (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 any publication printed, microfilmed, photocopied, or magnetically or otherwise recorded for auditory or visual usage).\
(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.213-3\cf4 , Notice to Supplier, in unpriced purchase orders.\
(d) (1) The contracting officer may use the clause at \cf3 52.213-4\cf4 , Terms and Conditions-Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services;), in simplified acquisitions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold that are for other than commercial products or commercial services (see \cf3 12.301\cf4 ).\
(2) The clause-\
(i) Is a compilation of the most commonly used clauses that apply to simplified acquisitions; and\
(ii) May be modified to fit the individual acquisition to add other needed clauses, or those clauses may be added\
separately. Modifications (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 additions, deletions, or substitutions) must not create a void or internal contradiction in the clause. For example, do not add an inspection and acceptance or termination for convenience requirement unless the existing requirement is deleted. Also, do not delete a paragraph without providing for an appropriate substitute.\
(3) (i) When an acquisition for supplies for use within the United States cannot be set aside for small business concerns and trade agreements apply (see \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 ), substitute the clause at \cf3 52.225-3\cf4 , Buy American-Free Trade Agreements- Israeli Trade Act, used with the appropriate Alternate (see \cf3 25.1101\cf4 (b)(1)), instead of the clause at \cf3 52.225-1\cf4 , Buy American- Supplies.\

\f0\b 13.303 Blanket purchase agreements (BPAs).\
13.303-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) A blanket purchase agreement (BPA) is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply (see \cf3 subpart 16.7 \cf4 for additional coverage of agreements).\
(b) BPAs should be established for use by an organization responsible for providing supplies for its own operations or for other offices, installations, projects, or functions. Such organizations, for example, may be organized supply points, separate independent or detached field parties, or one-person posts or activities.\
(c) The use of BPAs does not exempt an agency from the responsibility for keeping obligations and expenditures within available funds.\

\f0\b 13.303-2 Establishment of BPAs.\

\f1\b0 (a) The following are circumstances under which contracting officers may establish BPAs:\
(1) There is a wide variety of items in a broad class of supplies or services that are generally purchased, but the exact\
items, quantities, and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably.\
(2) There is a need to provide commercial sources of supply for one or more offices or projects in a given area that do\
not have or need authority to purchase otherwise.\
(3) The use of this procedure would avoid the writing of numerous purchase orders.\
(4) There is no existing requirements contract for the same supply or service that the contracting activity is required to\
use.\
(b) After determining a BPA would be advantageous, contracting officers shall-\
(1) Establish the parameters to limit purchases to individual items or commodity groups or classes, or permit the supplier to furnish unlimited supplies or services; and\
(2) Consider suppliers whose past performance has shown them to be dependable, who offer quality supplies or services at consistently lower prices, and who have provided numerous purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(c) BPAs may be established with-\
(1) More than one supplier for supplies or services of the same type to provide maximum practicable competition;\
(2) A single firm from which numerous individual purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold will likely\
be made in a given period; or\
(3) Federal Supply Schedule contractors, if not inconsistent with the terms of the applicable schedule contract.\
(d) BPAs should be prepared without a purchase requisition and only after contacting suppliers to make the necessary arrangements for-\
(1) Securing maximum discounts;\
(2) Documenting individual purchase transactions; (3) Periodic billings; and\
(4) Incorporating other necessary details.\

\f0\b 13.303-3 Preparation of BPAs.\

\f1\b0 Prepare BPAs on the forms specified in \cf3 13.307\cf4 . Do not cite accounting and appropriation data (see \cf3 13.303-5\cf4 (e)(4)). (a) The following terms and conditions are mandatory:\

\f2\i Invoices. 
\f1\i0 One of the following statements shall be included (except that the statement in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this subsection should not be used if the accumulation of the individual invoices by the Government materially increases the administrative costs of this purchase method):\
(i) A summary invoice shall be submitted at least monthly or upon expiration of this BPA, whichever occurs first, for all deliveries made during a billing period, identifying the delivery tickets covered therein, stating their total dollar value, and supported by receipt copies of the delivery tickets.\
(ii) An itemized invoice shall be submitted at least monthly or upon expiration of this BPA, whichever occurs first, for all deliveries made during a billing period and for which payment has not been received. These invoices need not be supported by copies of delivery tickets.\
(iii) When billing procedures provide for an individual invoice for each delivery, these invoices shall be accumulated, provided that-\
(A) A consolidated payment will be made for each specified period; and\
(B) The period of any discounts will commence on the final date of the billing period or on the date of receipt of invoices for all deliveries accepted during the billing period, whichever is later.\

\f0\b 13.303-5 Purchases under BPAs.\

\f1\b0 (a) Use a BPA only for purchases that are otherwise authorized by law or regulation.\
(b) Individual purchases shall not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. However, agency regulations may establish a higher threshold consistent with the following:\
(1) The simplified acquisition threshold and the $7.5 million limitation for individual purchases ($15 million for purchases entered into under the authority of \cf3 12.102\cf4 (f)(1)) do not apply to BPAs established in accordance with \cf3 13.303-2\cf4 (c) (3).\

(c) The existence of a BPA does not justify purchasing from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. The requirements of \cf3 13.003\cf4 (b) and \cf3 subpart 19.5 \cf4 also apply to each order.\
(d) If, for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Solicit quotations from other sources (see \cf3 13.105\cf4 ) and make the purchase as appropriate; and (2) Establish additional BPAs to facilitate future purchases if-\
(i) Recurring requirements for the same or similar supplies or services seem likely; (ii) Qualified sources are willing to accept BPAs; and\
(iii) It is otherwise practical to do so.\
(e) Limit documentation of purchases to essential information and forms as follows:\
(1) Purchases generally should be made electronically, or orally when it is not considered economical or practical to use\
electronic methods.\
(2) A paper purchase document may be issued if necessary to ensure that the supplier and the purchaser agree\
concerning the transaction.\
(3) Unless a paper document is issued, record essential elements (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 date, supplier, supplies or services, price,\
delivery date) on the purchase requisition, in an informal memorandum, or on a form developed locally for the purpose. (4) Cite the pertinent purchase requisitions and the accounting and appropriation data.\
(5) When delivery is made or the services are performed, the supplier\'92s sales document, delivery document, or\
invoice may (if it reflects the essential elements) be used for the purpose of recording receipt and acceptance of the\
supplies or services. However, if the purchase is assigned to another activity for administration, the authorized Government representative shall document receipt and acceptance of supplies or services by signing and dating the agency specified form after verification and after notation of any exceptions.\

\f0\b 13.303-6 Review procedures.\

(b) The contracting officer that entered into the BPA shall-\
(1) Ensure that each BPA is reviewed at least annually and, if necessary, updated at that time; and\
(2) Maintain awareness of changes in market conditions, sources of supply, and other pertinent factors that may warrant\
making new arrangements with different suppliers or modifying existing arrangements.\
(c) If an office other than the purchasing office that established a BPA is authorized to make purchases under that BPA, the\
agency that has jurisdiction over the office authorized to make the purchases shall ensure that the procedures in paragraph (a) of this subsection are being followed.\

\fs24 Subpart 13.4 - Fast Payment Procedure\

\fs20 13.401 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The fast payment procedure allows payment under limited conditions to a contractor prior to the Government\'92s verification that supplies have been received and accepted. The procedure provides for payment for supplies based on the contractor\'92s submission of an invoice that constitutes a certification that the contractor-\
(1) Has delivered the supplies to a post office, common carrier, or point of first receipt by the Government; and\
(2) Shall replace, repair, or correct supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to purchase agreements.\
(b) The contracting officer shall be primarily responsible for determining the amount of debts resulting from failure of contractors to properly replace, repair, or correct supplies lost, damaged, or not conforming to purchase requirements (see \cf3 32.602 \cf4 and \cf3 32.603\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 13.402 Conditions for use.\

\f1\b0 If the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section are present, the fast payment procedure may be used, provided that use of the procedure is consistent with the other conditions of the purchase. The conditions for use of the fast payment procedure are as follows:\
(a) Individual purchasing instruments do not exceed $35,000, except that executive agencies may permit higher dollar limitations for specified activities or items on a case-by-case basis.\
(b) Deliveries of supplies are to occur at locations where there is both a geographical separation and a lack of adequate communications facilities between Government receiving and disbursing activities that will make it impractical to make timely payment based on evidence of Government acceptance.\
(c) Titleto the supplies passes to the Government-\
(1) Upon delivery to a post office or common carrier for mailing or shipment to destination; or\
(2) Upon receipt by the Government if the shipment is by means other than Postal Service or common carrier.\
(d) The supplier agrees to replace, repair, or correct supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to purchase requirements.\
(e) The purchasing instrument is a firm-fixed-price contract, a purchase order, or a delivery order for supplies. (f) A system is in place to ensure-\
(1) Documentation of evidence of contractor performance under fast payment purchases;\
(2) Timely feedback to the contracting officer in case of contractor deficiencies; and\
(3) Identification of suppliers that have a current history of abusing the fast payment procedure (also see \cf3 subpart 9.1\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 13.403 Preparation and execution of orders.\

\f1\b0 Priced or unpriced contracts, purchase orders, or BPAs using the fast payment procedure shall include the following:\
(a) A requirement that the supplies be shipped transportation or postage prepaid.\
(b) A requirement that invoices be submitted directly to the finance or other office designated in the order, or in the case of\
unpriced purchase orders, to the contracting officer (see \cf3 13.302-2\cf4 (c)).\
(c) The following statement on the consignee\'92s copy:\
Consignee\'92s Notification to Purchasing Activity of Nonreceipt, Damage, or Nonconformance\
The consignee shall notify the purchasing office promptly after the specified date of delivery of supplies not received,\
damaged in transit, or not conforming to specifications of the purchase order. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, the notification should be made not later than 60 days after the specified date of delivery.\

\f0\b 13.404 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.213-1\cf4 , Fast Payment Procedure, in solicitations and contracts when the conditions in \cf3 13.402 \cf4 are applicable and it is intended that the fast payment procedure be used in the contract (in the case of BPAs, the contracting officer may elect to insert the clause either in the BPA or in orders under the BPA).\

\fs24 Subpart 13.5 - Simplified Procedures for Certain\
Commercial Products and Commercial Services\

\fs20 13.500 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart authorizes the use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7.5 million ($15 million for acquisitions as described in \cf3 13.500\cf4 (c)), including options, if the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that offers will include only commercial products or commercial services. Contracting officers may use any simplified acquisition procedure in this part, subject to any specific dollar limitation applicable to the particular procedure. The purpose of these simplified procedures is to vest contracting officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so that commercial acquisitions in this dollar range may be solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs\
for both the Government and industry (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3205-3208 \cf4 and chapter 241 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3305\cf4 , \cf3 3306\cf4 , and chapter 37, Awarding of Contracts).\
(b) When acquiring commercial products or commercial services using the procedures in this part, the requirements of \cf3 part 12 \cf4 apply subject to the order of precedence provided at \cf3 12.102\cf4 (c). This includes use of the provisions and clauses in \cf3 subpart 12.3\cf4 .\
(c) Under \cf3 41 U.S.C. 1903\cf4 , the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in this subpart may be used for acquisitions that do not exceed $15 million when-\

\f0\b 13.501 Special documentation requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Sole source (including brand name) acquisitions. (1) Acquisitions conducted under simplified acquisition procedures are exempt from the requirements in \cf3 part 6\cf4 . However, contracting officers must-\
(i) Conduct sole source acquisitions, as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 , (including brand name) under this subpart only if the need to do so is justified in writing and approved at the levels specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;\
(ii) Prepare sole source (including brand name) justifications using the format at \cf3 6.303-2\cf4 , modified to reflect that the procedures in FAR \cf3 subpart 13.5 \cf4 were used in accordance with \cf3 41 U.S.C.1901 \cf4 or the authority of \cf3 41 U.S.C.1903\cf4 ;\

brand-name, then it should so state; the approval level requirements will then only apply to that portion.\
(i) For a proposed contract exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, but not exceeding $750,000, the\
contracting officer\'92s certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer\'92s knowledge and belief will serve as approval, unless a higher approval level is established in accordance with agency procedures.\

(a) The basic requirements of contracting for supplies and services (including construction) by sealed bidding; (b) The information to be included in the solicitation (invitation for bids);\
(c) Procedures concerning the submission of bids;\
(d) Requirements for opening and evaluating bids and awarding contracts; and\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 14.1 - Use of Sealed Bidding\

\fs20 14.101 Elements of sealed bidding.\

\f1\b0 Sealed bidding is a method of contracting that employs competitive bids, public opening of bids, and awards. The following steps are involved:\
(a) 
\f2\i Preparation of invitations for bids
\f1\i0 . Invitations must describe the requirements of the Government clearly, accurately, and completely. Unnecessarily restrictive specifications or requirements that might unduly limit the number of bidders are prohibited. The invitation includes all documents (whether attached or incorporated by reference) furnished prospective bidders for the purpose of bidding.\
(b) 
\f2\i Publicizing the invitation for bids
\f1\i0 . Invitations must be publicized through distribution to prospective bidders, posting in public places, and such other means as may be appropriate. Publicizing must occur a sufficient time before public opening of bids to enable prospective bidders to prepare and submit bids.\
(c) 
\f2\i Submission of bids
\f1\i0 . Bidders must submit sealed bids to be opened at the time and place stated in the solicitation for the public opening of bids.\
(d) 
\f2\i Evaluation of bids
\f1\i0 . Bids shall be evaluated without discussions.\
(e) 
\f2\i Contract award
\f1\i0 . After bids are publicly opened, an award will be made with reasonable promptness to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors included in the invitation.\

\f0\b 14.102 [Reserved]\
14.103 Policy.\
14.103-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Sealed bidding shall be used whenever the conditions in \cf3 6.401\cf4 (a) are met. This requirement applies to any proposed contract action under \cf3 part 6\cf4 .\
(b) Sealed bidding may be used for classified acquisitions if its use does not violate agency security requirements. (c) The policy for pricing modifications of sealed bid contract appears in \cf3 15.403-4\cf4 (a)(1)(iii).\

\f0\b 14.103-2 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 No awards shall be made as a result of sealed bidding unless-\
(a) Bids have been solicited as required by \cf3 subpart 14.2\cf4 ;\
(b) Bids have been submitted as required by \cf3 subpart 14.3\cf4 ;\
(c) The requirements of \cf3 1.602-1\cf4 (b) and \cf3 part 6 \cf4 have been met; and\
(d) An award is made to the responsible bidder (see \cf3 9.1\cf4 ) whose bid is responsive to the terms of the invitation for bids and\
is most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price related factors included in the invitation, as provided in \cf3 subpart 14.4\cf4 .\

\f0\b 14.104 Types of contracts.\

\f1\b0 Firm-fixed-price contracts shall be used when the method of contracting is sealed bidding, except that fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses may be used if authorized in accordance with \cf3 16.203 \cf4 when some flexibility is necessary and feasible. Such clauses must afford all bidders an equal opportunity to bid.\

14.201-1 Uniform contract format.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers shall prepare invitations for bids and contracts using the uniform contract format outlined in Table 14-1 to the maximum practicable extent.

(2) Shipbuilding (including design, construction, and conversion), ship overhaul, and ship repair.\
(3) Subsistence items.\
(4) Supplies or services requiring special contract forms prescribed elsewhere in this regulation that are inconsistent\

(b) Information suitable for inclusion in invitations for bids under the uniform contract format shall also be included in\
invitations for bids not subject to that format if applicable.\
(c) Solicitations to which the uniform contract format applies shall include PartsI, II, III, and IV. If any section of the\
uniform contract format does not apply, the contracting officer should so mark that section in the solicitation. Upon award, the contracting officer shall not physically include PartIV in the resulting contract, but shall retain it in the contract file. (See \cf3 14.201\cf4 (c).) Award by acceptance of a bid on the award portion of \cf3 Standard Form 33\cf4 , Solicitation, Offer and Award (\cf3 SF 33\cf4 ), \cf3 Standard Form 26\cf4 , Award/Contract (\cf3 SF 26\cf4 ), or \cf3 Standard Form 1447\cf4 , Solicitation/Contract (\cf3 SF 1447\cf4 ), incorporates Section K, Representations, certifications, and other statements of bidders, in the resultant contract even though not physically attached. The representations and certifications shall be incorporated by reference in the contract by using \cf3 52.204-19 \cf4 (see \cf3 4.1202\cf4 (b)) or for acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services see \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 (v).\

\f1\b0 (a) Foreseeable costs or delays to the Government resulting from such factors as differences in inspection, locations of supplies, and transportation. If bids are on an f.o.b. origin basis (see \cf3 47.303 \cf4 and \cf3 47.305\cf4 ), transportation costs to the designated points shall be considered in determining the lowest cost to the Government.\
(b) Changes made, or requested by the bidder, in any of the provisions of the invitation for bids, if the change does not constitute a ground for rejection under \cf3 14.404\cf4 .\
(c) Advantages or disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (q)). The contracting officer shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative\
cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under a solicitation. Individual awards shall\
be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs.\

\f0\b 14.201-9 Simplified contract format.\

\f2\i\b0 Policy
\f1\i0 . For firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment acquisitions of supplies and services, the contracting officer may use the simplified contract format in lieu of the uniform contract format (see \cf3 14.201-1\cf4 ). The contracting officer has flexibility in preparation and organization of the simplified contract format. However, the following format should be used to the maximum practical extent:\
(a) 
\f2\i Solicitation/contract form
\f1\i0 . \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 1447\cf4 , Solicitation/Contract, shall be used as the first page of the solicitation.\
(b) 
\f2\i Contract schedule
\f1\i0 . Include the following for each line item:\
(1) Line item number.\
(2) Description of supplies or services, or data sufficient to identify the requirement.\
(3) Quantity and unit of issue.\
(4) Unit price and amount.\
(5) Packaging and marking requirements.\
(6) Inspection and acceptance, quality assurance, and reliability requirements.\

\f2\i Clauses
\f1\i0 . Include the clauses required by this regulation. Additional clauses shall be incorporated only when considered absolutely necessary to the particular acquisition.\
(d) 
\f2\i List of documents and attachments
\f1\i0 . Include if necessary.\
(e) Representations and instructions- (1) 
\f2\i Representations and certifications
\f1\i0 . Insert those solicitation provisions that require representations, certifications, or the submission of other information by offerors.\
(2) 
\f2\i Instructions, conditions, and notices
\f1\i0 . Include the solicitation provisions required by \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 . Include any other information/instructions necessary to guide offerors.\
(3) 
\f2\i Evaluation factors for award
\f1\i0 . Insert all evaluation factors and any significant subfactors for award.\
(4) Upon award, the contracting officer need not physically include the provisions in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this subsection in the resulting contract, but shall retain them in the contract file. Award by acceptance of a bid on the award portion of \cf3 SF 1447 \cf4 incorporates the representations, certifications, and other statements of bidders in the resultant contract even though not physically attached.\

\f0\b 14.202 General rules for solicitation of bids.\
14.202-1 Bidding time.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Policy
\f1\i0 . A reasonable time for prospective bidders to prepare and submit bids shall be allowed in all invitations, consistent with the needs of the Government. (For construction contracts, see \cf3 36.213-3\cf4 (a).) A bidding time (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 the time between issuance of the solicitation and opening of bids) of at least 30 calendar days shall be provided, when synopsis is required by \cf3 subpart 5.2\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Factors to be considered
\f1\i0 . Because of unduly limited bidding time, some potential sources may be precluded from bidding and others may be forced to include amounts for contingencies that, with additional time, could be eliminated. To\

\fs20 avoid unduly restricting competition or paying higher-than-necessary prices, consideration shall be given to such factors as the following in establishing a reasonable bidding time:\
(1) Degree of urgency;\
(2) Complexity of requirement;\
(3) Anticipated extent of subcontracting;\
(4) Whether use was made of presolicitation notices;\
(5) Geographic distribution of bidders; and\
(6) Normal transmittal time for both invitations and bids.\

\f0\b 14.202-2 [Reserved]\
14.202-3 Bid envelopes.\

\f1\b0 (a) Postage or envelopes bearing "Postage and Fees Paid" indicia shall not be distributed with the invitation for bids or otherwise supplied to prospective bidders.\
(b) To provide for ready identification and proper handling of bids, \cf3 Optional Form 17\cf4 , Offer Label, may be furnished with each bid set. The form may be obtained from the General Services Administration (see \cf3 53.107\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 14.202-4 Bid samples.\

\f1\b0 (a) Policy. (1) Bidders shall not be required to furnish bid samples unless there are characteristics of the product that cannot be described adequately in the specification or purchase description.\
(2) Bid samples will be used only to determine the responsiveness of the bid and will not be used to determine a bidder\'92s ability to produce the required items.\
(3) Bid samples may be examined for any required characteristic, whether or not such characteristic is adequately described in the specification, if listed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.\
(4) Bids will be rejected as nonresponsive if the sample fails to conform to each of the characteristics listed in the invitation.\
(b) 
\f2\i When to use
\f1\i0 . The use of bid samples would be appropriate for products that must be suitable from the standpoint\
of balance, facility of use, general "feel," color, pattern, or other characteristics that cannot be described adequately in the specification. However, when more than a minor portion of the characteristics of the product cannot be adequately described in the specification, products should be acquired by two-step sealed bidding or negotiation, as appropriate.\
(c) 
\f2\i Justification
\f1\i0 . The reasons why acceptable products cannot be acquired without the submission of bid samples shall be set forth in the contract file, except where the submission is required by the formal specifications (Federal, Military, or other) applicable to the acquisition.\
(d) Requirements for samples in invitations for bids. (1) Invitations for bids shall-\
(i) State the number and, if appropriate, the size of the samples to be submitted and otherwise fully describe the\
samples required; and\
(ii) List all the characteristics for which the samples will be examined.\
(2) If bid samples are required, see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (o).\
(e) Waiver of requirement for bid samples. (1) The requirement for furnishing bid samples may be waived when a\
bidder offers a product previously or currently being contracted for or tested by the Government and found to comply with specification requirements conforming in every material respect with those in the current invitation for bids. When the requirement may be waived, see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (o)(2).\
(2) Where samples required by a Federal, Military, or other formal specification are not considered necessary and a waiver of the sample requirements of the specification has been authorized, a statement shall be included in the invitation that notwithstanding the requirements of the specification, samples will not be required.\
(f) 
\f2\i Unsolicited samples
\f1\i0 . Bid samples furnished with a bid that are not required by the invitation generally will not be considered as qualifying the bid and will be disregarded. However, the bid sample will not be disregarded if it is clear from the bid or accompanying papers that the bidder\'92s intention was to qualify the bid. (See \cf3 14.404-2\cf4 (d) if the qualification does not conform to the solicitation.)\
(g) Handling bid samples. (1) Samples that are not destroyed in testing shall be returned to bidders at their request and expense, unless otherwise specified in the invitation.\
(2) Disposition instructions shall be requested from bidders and samples disposed of accordingly.\

(4) Samples that are to be retained for inspection purposes in connection with deliveries shall be transmitted to the inspecting activity concerned, with instructions to retain the sample until completion of the contract or until disposition instructions are furnished.\
(5) Where samples are consumed or their usefulness is impaired by tests, they will be disposed of as scrap unless the bidder requests their return.\

\f0\b 14.202-5 Descriptive literature.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Policy
\f1\i0 . Contracting officers must not require bidders to furnish descriptive literature unless it is needed before award to determine whether the products offered meet the specification and to establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish.\
(b) 
\f2\i Justification
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer must document in the contract file the reasons why product acceptability cannot be determined without the submission of descriptive literature, except when the contract specifications require submission.\
(c) Requirements of invitation for bids. (1) The invitation must clearly state- (i) What descriptive literature the bidders must furnish;\
(ii) The purpose for requiring the literature;\
(iii) The extent of its consideration in the evaluation of bids; and\
(iv) The rules that will apply if a bidder fails to furnish the literature before bid opening or if the literature provided does not comply with the requirements of the invitation.\
(2) If bidders must furnish descriptive literature, see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (p).\
(d) Waiver of requirement for descriptive literature. (1) The contracting officer may waive the requirement for descriptive\
literature if-\
(i) The bidder states in the bid that the product being offered is the same as a product previously or currently being\
furnished to the contracting activity; and\
(ii) The contracting officer determines that the product offered by the bidder complies with the specification\
requirements of the current invitation for bids. When the contracting officer waives the requirement, see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (p)(2). (2) When descriptive literature is not necessary and a waiver of literature requirements of a specification has\
been authorized, the contracting officer must include a statement in the invitation that, despite the requirements of the specifications, descriptive literature will not be required.\
(3) If the solicitation provides for a waiver, a bidder may submit a bid on the basis of either the descriptive literature furnished with the bid or a previously furnished product. If the bid is submitted on one basis, the bidder may not have it considered on the other basis after bids are opened.\
(e) 
\f2\i Unsolicited descriptive literature
\f1\i0 . If descriptive literature is furnished when it is not required by the invitation for bids, the procedures set forth in \cf3 14.202-4\cf4 (f) must be followed.\

\f0\b 14.202-6 Final review of invitations for bids.\

\f1\b0 Each invitation for bids shall be thoroughly reviewed before issuance to detect and correct discrepancies or ambiguities that could limit competition or result in the receipt of nonresponsive bids. Contracting officers are responsible for the reviews.\

\f0\b 14.202-7 Facsimile bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unless prohibited or otherwise restricted by agency procedures, contracting officers may authorize facsimile bids (see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (v)). In determining whether or not to authorize facsimile bids, the contracting officer shall consider factors such as-\
(1) Anticipated bid size and volume;\
(2) Urgency of the requirement;\
(3) Frequency of price changes;\
(4) Availability, reliability, speed, and capacity of the receiving facsimile equipment; and\
(5) Adequacy of administrative procedures and controls for receiving, identifying, recording, and safeguarding\
facsimile bids, and ensuring their timely delivery to the bids opening location.\
(b) If facsimile bids are authorized, contracting officers may, after the date set for bid opening, request the apparently\
successful offeror to provide the complete, original signed bid.\

\f1\b0 In accordance with \cf3 subpart 4.5\cf4 , contracting officers may authorize use of electronic commerce for submission of bids. If electronic bids are authorized, the solicitation shall specify the electronic commerce method(s) that bidders may use.\

\f0\b 14.203 Methods of soliciting bids.\
14.203-1 Transmittal to prospective bidders.\

\f1\b0 Invitations for bids or presolicitation notices must be provided in accordance with \cf3 5.102\cf4 . When a contracting office is located in the United States, any solicitation sent to a prospective bidder located outside the United States shall be sent by electronic data interchange or air mail if security classification permits.\

\f0\b 14.203-2 Dissemination of information concerning invitations for bids.\

\f1\b0 Procedures concerning display of invitations for bids in a public place, information releases to newspapers and trade journals, paid advertisements, and synopsizing through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) are set forth in \cf3 5.101 \cf4 and \cf3 subpart 5.2\cf4 .\

\f0\b 14.203-3 Master solicitation.\

\f1\b0 The master solicitation is provided to potential sources who are requested to retain it for continued and repetitive use. Individual solicitations must reference the date of the current master solicitation and identify any changes. The contracting officer must-\
(a) Make available copies of the master solicitation on request; and\
(b) Provide the cognizant contract administration activity a current copy of the master solicitation.\

\f0\b 14.204 Records of invitations for bids and records of bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) Each contracting office shall retain a record of each invitation that it issues and each abstract or record of bids. Contracting officers shall review and utilize the information available in connection with subsequent acquisitions of the same or similar items.\
(b) The file for each invitation shall show the distribution that was made and the date the invitation was issued. The names and addresses of prospective bidders who requested the invitation and were not included on the original solicitation list shall be added to the list and made a part of the record.\

\f0\b 14.205 Presolicitation notices.\

\f1\b0 In lieu of initially forwarding complete bid sets, the contracting officer may send presolicitation notices to concerns. The notice shall-\
(a) Specify the final date for receipt of requests for a complete bid set;\
(b) Briefly describe the requirement and furnish other essential information to enable concerns to determine whether they have an interest in the invitation; and\
(c) Normally not include drawings, plans, and specifications. The return date of the notice must be sufficiently in advance of the mailing date of the invitation for bids to permit an accurate estimate of the number of bid sets required. Bid sets shall be sent to concerns that request them in response to the notice.\

\f0\b 14.206 [Reserved]\
14.207 Pre-bid conference.\

\f1\b0 A pre-bid conference may be used, generally in a complex acquisition, as a means of briefing prospective bidders and explaining complicated specifications and requirements to them as early as possible after the invitation has been issued and before the bids are opened. It shall never be used as a substitute for amending a defective or ambiguous invitation. The conference shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure prescribed in \cf3 15.201\cf4 .\

\f0\b 14.208 Amendment of invitation for bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) If it becomes necessary to make changes in quantity, specifications, delivery schedules, opening dates, etc., or to correct a defective or ambiguous invitation, such changes shall be accomplished by amendment of the invitation for bids using \cf3 Standard Form 30\cf4 , Amendment of Solicitation/ Modification of Contract.

\f1\b0 pre-bid conference does not relieve the necessity for issuing an amendment. Amendments shall be sent, before the time for bid opening, to everyone to whom invitations have been furnished and shall be displayed in the bid room.\
(b) Before amending an invitation for bids, the contracting officer shall consider the period of time remaining until bid opening and the need to extend this period.\
(c) Any information given to a prospective bidder concerning an invitation for bids shall be furnished promptly to all other prospective bidders as an amendment to the invitation (1) if such information is necessary for bidders to submit bids or (2)\
if the lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed bidders. The information shall be furnished even though\
a pre-bid conference is held. No award shall be made on the invitation unless such amendment has been issued in sufficient time to permit all prospective bidders to consider such information in submitting or modifying their bids.\

\f0\b 14.209 Cancellation of invitations before opening.\

\f1\b0 (a) The cancellation of an invitation for bids usually involves a loss of time, effort, and money spent by the Government and bidders. Invitations should not be cancelled unless cancellation is clearly in the public interest; 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 ,\
(1) Where there is no longer a requirement for the supplies or services; or\
(2) Where amendments to the invitation would be of such magnitude that a new invitation is desirable.\
(b) When an invitation issued other than electronically is cancelled, bids that have been received shall be returned\
unopened to the bidders and notice of cancellation shall be sent to all prospective bidders to whom invitations were issued. When an invitation issued electronically is cancelled, a general notice of cancellation shall be posted electronically, the bids received shall not be viewed, and the bids shall be purged from primary and backup data storage systems.\
(c) The notice of cancellation shall-(1) identify the invitation for bids by number and short title or subject matter, (2) briefly explain the reason the invitation is being cancelled, and (3) where appropriate, assure prospective bidders that they will be given an opportunity to bid on any resolicitation of bids or any future requirements for the type of supplies or services involved. Cancellations shall be recorded in accordance with \cf3 14.403\cf4 (d).\

\f0\b 14.210 Qualified products.\

Within the Government, such information shall be restricted to those having a legitimate interest. Releases of information shall be made (1)to all prospective bidders, and (2)as nearly\
as possible at the same time, so that one prospective bidder shall not be given unfair advantage over another. See \cf3 3.104 \cf4 regarding requirements for proprietary and source selection information including access to and disclosure thereof.\
(b) 
\f2\i After solicitation
\f1\i0 . Discussions with prospective bidders regarding a solicitation shall be conducted and technical or other information shall be transmitted only by the contracting officer or superiors having contractual authority or by others specifically authorized. Such personnel shall not furnish any information to a prospective bidder that alone or together with other information may afford an advantage over others. However, general information that would not be prejudicial to other prospective bidders may be furnished upon request; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 explanation of a particular contract clause or a particular condition of the schedule in the invitation for bids, and more specific information or clarifications may be furnished by amending the solicitation (see \cf3 14.208\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 14.212 Economic purchase quantities (supplies).\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers shall comply with the economic purchase quantity planning requirements for supplies in \cf3 subpart 7.2\cf4 . See \cf3 7.203 \cf4 for instructions regarding use of the provision at \cf3 52.207-4\cf4 , Economic Purchase Quantity-Supplies, and \cf3 7.204 \cf4 for guidance on handling responses to that provision.\

If no time is specified in the IFB, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that bids are due.\
(b) (1) Any bid, modification, or withdrawal of a bid received at the Government office designated in the IFB after the exact time specified for receipt of bids is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the contracting officer determines that accepting the late bid would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-\
(i) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the IFB, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. oneworking day prior to the date specified for receipt of bids; or\
(ii) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of bids and was under the Government\'92s control prior to the time set for receipt of bids.\
(2) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful bid, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.\
(c) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the bid wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.\

If the IFB authorizes facsimile bids, bids may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of bids, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at \cf3 52.214-31\cf4 , Facsimile Bids. A bid may be withdrawn in person by a bidder or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of bids, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the bid. Upon withdrawal of an electronically transmitted bid, the data received must not be viewed and, where practicable, must be purged from primary and backup data storage systems.\
(f) The contracting officer must promptly notify any bidder if its bid, modification, or withdrawal was received late, and must inform the bidder whether its bid will be considered, unless contract award is imminent and the notices prescribed in \cf3 14.409 \cf4 would suffice.\
(g) Late bids and modifications that are not considered must be held unopened, unless opened for identification, until after award and then retained with other unsuccessful bids. However, any bid bond or guarantee must be returned.\
(h) If available, the following must be included in the contract files for each late bid, modification, or withdrawal: (1) The date and hour of receipt.\
(2) A statement, with supporting rationale, regarding whether the bid was considered for award.\
(3) The envelope, wrapper, or other evidence of the date of receipt.\

\fs24 Subpart 14.4 - Opening of Bids and Award of Contract\

\fs20 14.400 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart contains procedures for the receipt, handling, opening, and disposition of bids including mistakes in bids, and subsequent award of contracts.\

\f0\b 14.401 Receipt and safeguarding of bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) All bids (including modifications) received before the time set for the opening of bids shall be kept secure. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the bids shall not be opened or viewed, and shall remain in a locked bid box, a safe, or in a secured, restricted-access electronic bid box. If an invitation for bids is cancelled, bids shall be returned to the bidders. Necessary precautions shall be taken to ensure the security of the bid box or safe. Before bid opening, information concerning the identity and number of bids received shall be made available only to Government employees. Such disclosure shall\
be only on a "need to know" basis. When bid samples are submitted, they shall be handled with sufficient care to prevent disclosure of characteristics before bid opening.\
(b) Envelopes marked as bids but not identifying the bidder or the solicitation may be opened solely for the purpose of identification, and then only by an official designated for this purpose. If a sealed bid is opened by mistake (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 because it is not marked as being a bid), the envelope shall be signed by the opener, whose position shall also be written thereon, and delivered to the designated official. This official shall immediately write on the envelope (1)an explanation of the opening, (2) the date and time opened, and (3) the invitation for bids number, and shall sign the envelope. The official shall then immediately reseal the envelope.\

\f0\b 14.402 Opening of bids.\
14.402-1 Unclassified bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) The bid opening officer shall decide when the time set for opening bids has arrived and shall inform those present of that decision. The officer shall then (1) personally and publicly open all bids received before that time, (2)if practical, read the bids aloud to the persons present, and (3) have the bids recorded. The original of each bid shall be carefully safeguarded, particularly until the abstract of bids required by \cf3 14.403 \cf4 has been made and its accuracy verified.\
(b) Performance of the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section may be delegated to an assistant, but the bid opening officer remains fully responsible for the actions of the assistant.\
(c) Examination of bids by interested persons shall be permitted if it does not interfere unduly with the conduct of Government business. Original bids shall not be allowed to pass out of the hands of a Government official unless a duplicate bid is not available for public inspection. The original bid may be examined by the public only under the immediate supervision of a Government official and under conditions that preclude possibility of a substitution, addition, deletion, or alteration in the bid.\

\f0\b 14.402-2 Classified bids.\

\f1\b0 The general public may not attend bid openings for classified acquisitions. A bidder or its representative may attend and record the results if the individual has the appropriate security clearance. The contracting officer also may make the bids available at a later time to properly cleared individuals who represent bidders. No public record shall be made of bids or bid prices received in response to classified invitations for bids.\

\f0\b 14.402-3 Postponement of openings.\

\f1\b0 (a) A bid opening may be postponed even after the time scheduled for bid opening (but otherwise in accordance with \cf3 14.208\cf4 ) when-\
(1) The contracting officer has reason to believe that the bids of an important segment of bidders have been delayed in the mails, or in the communications system specified for transmission of bids, for causes beyond their control and without their fault or negligence (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 flood, fire, accident, weather conditions, strikes, or Government equipment blackout or malfunction when bids are due); or\
(2) Emergency or unanticipated events interrupt normal governmental processes so that the conduct of bid opening as scheduled is impractical.\

\fs20 (b) At the time of a determination to postpone a bid opening under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an announcement of the determination shall be publicly posted. If practical before issuance of a formal amendment of the invitation, the determination shall be otherwise communicated to prospective bidders who are likely to attend the scheduled bid opening.\
(c) In the case of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and when urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation as prescribed in \cf3 14.208\cf4 , the time specified for opening of bids will be deemed to be extended to the same time\
of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. In such cases, the time of actual bid opening shall be deemed to be the time set for bid opening for the purpose of determining "late bids" under \cf3 14.304\cf4 . A note should be made on the abstract of bids or otherwise added to the file explaining the circumstances of the postponement.\

\f0\b 14.403 Recording of bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 Standard Form 1409\cf4 , Abstract of Offers, or \cf3 Optional Form 1419\cf4 , Abstract of Offers-Construction (or automated equivalent), shall be completed and certified as to its accuracy by the bid opening officer as soon after bid opening as practicable. Where bid items are too numerous to warrant complete recording of all bids, abstract entries for individual bids may be limited to item numbers and bid prices. In preparing these forms, the extra columns and \cf3 SF 1410\cf4 , Abstract of Offers- Continuation, and \cf3 OF 1419A\cf4 , Abstract of Offer-Construction, Continuation Sheet, may be used to label and record such information as the contracting activity deems necessary.\
(b) Abstracts of offers for unclassified acquisitions shall be available for public inspection. Such abstracts shall not contain information regarding failure to meet minimum standards of responsibility, apparent collusion of bidders, or other notations properly exempt from disclosure to the public in accordance with agency regulations implementing \cf3 subpart 24.2\cf4 .\
(c) The forms identified in paragraph (a) of this section need not be used by the Defense Energy Support Center for acquisitions of coal or petroleum products or by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia for perishable subsistence items. (d) If an invitation for bids is canceled before the time set for bid opening, this fact shall be recorded together with a\
statement of the number of bids invited and the number of bids received.\

\f0\b 14.404 Rejection of bids.\
14.404-1 Cancellation of invitations after opening.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Preservation of the integrity of the competitive bid system dictates that, after bids have been opened, award must be made to that responsible bidder who submitted the lowest responsive bid, unless there is a compelling reason to reject all bids and cancel the invitation.\
(2) Every effort shall be made to anticipate changes in a requirement before the date of opening and to notify all prospective bidders of any resulting modification or cancellation. This will permit bidders to change their bids and prevent unnecessary exposure of bid prices.\
(3) As a general rule, after the opening of bids, an invitation should not be cancelled and resolicited due solely to increased requirements for the items being acquired. Award should be made on the initial invitation for bids and the additional quantity should be treated as a new acquisition.\
(b) When it is determined before award but after opening that the requirements of \cf3 11.201 \cf4 (relating to the availability and identification of specifications) have not been met, the invitation shall be cancelled.\
(c) Invitations may be cancelled and all bids rejected before award but after opening when, consistent with subparagraph (a)(1) of this section, the agency head determines in writing that-\
(1) Inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the invitation;\
(2) Specifications have been revised;\
(3) The supplies or services being contracted for are no longer required;\
(4) The invitation did not provide for consideration of all factors of cost to the Government, such as cost of transporting\
Government-furnished property to bidders\'92 plants;\
(5) Bids received indicate that the needs of the Government can be satisfied by a less expensive article differing from\
that for which the bids were invited;\
(6) All otherwise acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices, or only one bid is received and the contracting\
officer cannot determine the reasonableness of the bid price;\
(7) The bids were not independently arrived at in open competition, were collusive, or were submitted in bad faith (see\
\cf3 subpart 3.3 \cf4 for reports to be made to the Department of Justice);\
(8) No responsive bid has been received from a responsible bidder;\

\f0\b\fs20 14.404-2\
 
\f1\b0 (9) A cost comparison as prescribed in OMB CircularA-76 and \cf3 subpart 7.3 \cf4 shows that performance by the Government is more economical; or\
(10) For other reasons, cancellation is clearly in the public\'92s interest.\
(d) Should administrative difficulties be encountered after bid opening that may delay award beyond bidders\'92 acceptance\
periods, the several lowest bidders whose bids have not expired (irrespective of the acceptance period specified in the bid) should be requested, before expiration of their bids, to extend in writing the bid acceptance period (with consent of sureties, if any) in order to avoid the need for resoliciting.\
(e) Under some circumstances, completion of the acquisition after cancellation of the invitation for bids may be appropriate.\
(1) If the invitation for bids has been cancelled for the reasons specified in subparagraphs(c)(6), (7), or (8) of this subsection, and the agency head has authorized, in the determination in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the completion of the acquisition through negotiation, the contracting officer shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this subsection.\
(2) If the invitation for bids has been cancelled for the reasons specified in subparagraphs(c)(1), (2), (4), (5), or (10) of this subsection, or for the reasons in subparagraphs(c)(6), (7), or (8) of this subsection and completion through negotiation is not authorized under subparagraph (e)(1) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall proceed with a new acquisition.\
(f) When the agency head has determined, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this subsection, that an invitation for bids should be canceled and that use of negotiation is in the Government\'92s interest, the contracting officer may negotiate (in accordance with \cf3 part 15\cf4 , as appropriate) and make award without issuing a new solicitation provided-\
(1) Each responsible bidder in the sealed bid acquisition has been given notice that negotiations will be conducted and has been given an opportunity to participate in negotiations; and\
(2) The award is made to the responsible bidder offering the lowest negotiated price.\

\f0\b 14.404-2 Rejection of individual bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) Any bid that fails to conform to the essential requirements of the invitation for bids shall be rejected.\
(b) Any bid that does not conform to the applicable specifications shall be rejected unless the invitation authorized the submission of alternate bids and the supplies offered as alternates meet the requirements specified in the invitation.\
(c) Any bid that fails to conform to the delivery schedule or permissible alternates stated in the invitation shall be rejected.\
(d) A bid shall be rejected when the bidder imposes conditions that would modify requirements of the invitation or limit the bidder\'92s liability to the Government, since to allow the bidder to impose such conditions would be prejudicial to other bidders. For example, bids shall be rejected in which the bidder-\
(1) Protects against future changes in conditions, such as increased costs, if total possible costs to the Government cannot be determined;\
(2) Fails to state a price and indicates that price shall be "price in effect at time of delivery;"\
(3) States a price but qualifies it as being subject to "price in effect at time of delivery;"\
(4) When not authorized by the invitation, conditions or qualifies a bid by stipulating that it is to be considered only if,\
before date of award, the bidder receives (or does not receive) award under a separate solicitation;\
(5) Requires that the Government is to determine that the bidder\'92s product meets applicable Government specifications;\
or\
(6) Limits rights of the Government under any contract clause.\
(e) A low bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from a bid provided the conditions do not go to the substance, as distinguished from the form, of the bid, or work an injustice on other bidders. A condition goes to the substance of a bid where it affects price, quantity, quality, or delivery of the items offered.\
(f) Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines in writing that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well.\
(g) Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items or subline items are materially unbalanced (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (g)).\
(h) Bids received from any person or concern that is suspended, debarred, proposed for debarment or declared ineligible as of the bid opening date shall be rejected unless a compelling reason determination is made (see \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 ).\
(i) Low bids received from concerns determined to be not responsible pursuant to subpart \cf3 9.1 \cf4 shall be rejected (but if a bidder is a small business concern, see19.6 with respect to certificates of competency).\
(j) When a bid guarantee is required and a bidder fails to furnish the guarantee in accordance with the requirements of the invitation for bids, the bid shall be rejected, except as otherwise provided in \cf3 28.101-4\cf4 .\
(k) The originals of all rejected bids, and any written findings with respect to such rejections, shall be preserved with the papers relating to the acquisition.\

\fs20 (l) After submitting a bid, if all of a bidder\'92s assets or that part related to the bid are transferred during the period between the bid opening and the award, the transferee may not be able to take over the bid. Accordingly, the contracting officer shall reject the bid unless the transfer is effected by merger, operation of law, or other means not barred by \cf3 41 U.S.C.6305 \cf4 or \cf3 31 U.S.C.3727\cf4 .\

\f0\b 14.404-3 Notice to bidders of rejection of all bids.\

\f1\b0 When it is determined necessary to reject all bids, the contracting officer shall notify each bidder that all bids have been rejected and shall state the reason for such action.\

\f0\b 14.404-4 Restrictions on disclosure of descriptive literature.\

\f1\b0 When a bid is accompanied by descriptive literature (as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 ), and the bidder imposes a restriction that prevents the public disclosure of such literature, the restriction may render the bid nonresponsive. The restriction renders the bid nonresponsive if it prohibits the disclosure of sufficient information to permit competing bidders to know the essential nature and type of the products offered or those elements of the bid that relate to quantity, price, and delivery terms. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to unsolicited descriptive literature submitted by a bidder if such literature does not qualify the bid (see \cf3 14.202-5\cf4 (e)).\

\f0\b 14.404-5 All or none qualifications.\

\f1\b0 Unless the solicitation provides otherwise, a bid may be responsive notwithstanding that the bidder specifies that award will be accepted only on all, or a specified group, of the items. Bidders shall not be permitted to withdraw or modify "all or none" qualifications after bid opening since such qualifications are substantive and affect the rights of other bidders.\

\f0\b 14.405 Minor informalities or irregularities in bids.\

\f1\b0 A minor informality or irregularity is one that is merely a matter of form and not of substance. It also pertains to some immaterial defect in a bid or variation of a bid from the exact requirements of the invitation that can be corrected or waived without being prejudicial to other bidders. The defect or variation is immaterial when the effect on price, quantity, quality, or delivery is negligible when contrasted with the total cost or scope of the supplies or services being acquired. The contracting officer either shall give the bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity\
in a bid or waive the deficiency, whichever is to the advantage of the Government. Examples of minor informalities or irregularities include failure of a bidder to-\
(a) Return the number of copies of signed bids required by the invitation; (b) Furnish required information concerning the number of its employees; (c) Sign its bid, but only if-\
(1) The unsigned bid is accompanied by other material indicating the bidder\'92s intention to be bound by the unsigned bid (such as the submission of a bid guarantee or a letter signed by the bidder, with the bid, referring to and clearly identifying the bid itself); or\
(2) The firm submitting a bid has formally adopted or authorized, before the date set for opening of bids, the execution of documents by typewritten, printed, or stamped signature and submits evidence of such authorization and the bid carries such a signature;\
(d) Acknowledge receipt of an amendment to an invitation for bids, but only if-\
(1) The bid received clearly indicates that the bidder received the amendment, such as where the amendment added\
another item to the invitation and the bidder submitted a bid on the item; or\
(2) The amendment involves only a matter of form or has either no effect or merely a negligible effect on price,\
quantity, quality, or delivery of the item bid upon; and\
(e) Execute the representations with respect to Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Programs, as set forth in the\
clauses at \cf3 52.222-22\cf4 , Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports, and \cf3 52.222-25\cf4 , Affirmative Action Compliance.\

\f0\b 14.406 Receipt of an unreadable electronic bid.\

\f1\b0 If a bid received at the Government facility by electronic data interchange is unreadable to the degree that conformance to the essential requirements of the invitation for bids cannot be ascertained, the contracting officer immediately shall notify the bidder that the bid will be rejected unless the bidder provides clear and convincing evidence-\
(a) Of the content of the bid as originally submitted; and\

Government mishandling.\

\f0\b 14.407 Mistakes in bids.\
14.407-1 General.\

\f1\b0 After the opening of bids, contracting officers shall examine all bids for mistakes. In cases of apparent mistakes and in cases where the contracting officer has reason to believe that a mistake may have been made, the contracting officer shall request from the bidder a verification of the bid, calling attention to the suspected mistake. If the bidder alleges a mistake, the matter shall be processed in accordance with this section \cf3 14.407\cf4 . Such actions shall be taken before award.\

\f0\b 14.407-2 Apparent clerical mistakes.\

\f1\b0 (a) Any clerical mistake, apparent on its face in the bid, may be corrected by the contracting officer before award. The contracting officer first shall obtain from the bidder a verification of the bid intended. Examples of apparent mistakes are-\
(1) Obvious misplacement of a decimal point;\
(2) Obviously incorrect discounts (for example, 1 percent 10 days, 2 percent 20 days, 5 percent 30 days); (3) Obvious reversal of the price f.o.b. destination and price f.o.b. origin; and\
(4) Obvious mistake in designation of unit.\
(b) Correction of the bid shall be effected by attaching the verification to the original bid and a copy of the verification to the duplicate bid. Correction shall not be made on the face of the bid; however, it shall be reflected in the award document.\
(c) Correction of bids submitted by electronic data interchange shall be effected by including in the electronic solicitation file the original bid, the verification request, and the bid verification.\

\f0\b 14.407-3 Other mistakes disclosed before award.\

\f1\b0 In order to minimize delays in contract awards, administrative determinations may be made as described in this \cf3 14.407-3 \cf4 in connection with mistakes in bids alleged after opening of bids and before award. The authority to permit correction of bids is limited to bids that, as submitted, are responsive to the invitation and may not be used to permit correction of bids to make them responsive. This authority is in addition to that in \cf3 14.407-2 \cf4 or that may be otherwise available.\
(a) If a bidder requests permission to correct a mistake and clear and convincing evidence establishes both the existence of the mistake and the bid actually intended, the agency head may make a determination permitting the bidder to correct the mistake; provided, that if this correction would result in displacing one or more lower bids, such a determination shall not be made unless the existence of the mistake and the bid actually intended are ascertainable substantially from the invitation and the bid itself.\
(b) If-\
(1) A bidder requests permission to withdraw a bid rather than correct it;\
(2) The evidence is clear and convincing both as to the existence of a mistake and as to the bid actually intended; and (3) The bid, both as uncorrected and as corrected, is the lowest received, the agency head may make a determination to\
correct the bid and not permit its withdrawal.\
(c) If, under paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, (1) the evidence of a mistake is clear and convincing only as to the\
mistake but not as to the intended bid, or (2) the evidence reasonably supports the existence of a mistake but is not clear and convincing, an official above the contracting officer, unless otherwise provided by agency procedures, may make a determination permitting the bidder to withdraw the bid.\
(d) If the evidence does not warrant a determination under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the agency head may make a determination that the bid be neither withdrawn nor corrected.\
(e) Heads of agencies may delegate their authority to make the determinations under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this \cf3 14.407-3 \cf4 to a central authority, or a limited number of authorities as necessary, in their agencies, without power of redelegation.\
(f) Each proposed determination shall have the concurrence of legal counsel within the agency concerned before issuance.\
(g) Suspected or alleged mistakes in bids shall be processed as follows. A mere statement by the administrative officials that they are satisfied that an error was made is insufficient.\
(1) The contracting officer shall immediately request the bidder to verify the bid. Action taken to verify bids must be sufficient to reasonably assure the contracting officer that the bid as confirmed is without error, or to elicit the allegation of\

\fs20 a mistake by the bidder. To assure that the bidder will be put on notice of a mistake suspected by the contracting officer, the bidder should be advised as appropriate-\
(i) That its bid is so much lower than the other bids or the Government\'92s estimate as to indicate a possibility of error; (ii) Of important or unusual characteristics of the specifications;\
(iii) Of changes in requirements from previous purchases of a similar item; or\
(iv) Of any other information, proper for disclosure, that leads the contracting officer to believe that there is a\
mistake in bid.\
(2) If the bid is verified, the contracting officer shall consider the bid as originally submitted. If the time for acceptance\
of bids is likely to expire before a decision can be made, the contracting officer shall request all bidders whose bids may become eligible for award to extend the time for acceptance of their bids in accordance with \cf3 14.404-1\cf4 (d). If the bidder whose bid is believed erroneous does not (or cannot) grant an extension of time, the bid shall be considered as originally submitted (but see paragraph (g)(5) of this section). If the bidder alleges a mistake, the contracting officer shall advise the bidder to make a written request to withdraw or modify the bid. The request must be supported by statements (sworn statements, if possible) and shall include all pertinent evidence such as the bidder\'92s file copy of the bid, the original worksheets and other data used in preparing the bid, subcontractors\'92 quotations, if any, published price lists, and any other evidence that establishes the existence of the error, the manner in which it occurred, and the bid actually intended.\
(3) When the bidder furnishes evidence supporting an alleged mistake, the contracting officer shall refer the case to the appropriate authority (see paragraph (e) of this section) together with the following data:\
(i) A signed copy of the bid involved.\
(ii) A copy of the invitation for bids and any specifications or drawings relevant to the alleged mistake.\
(iii) An abstract or record of the bids received.\
(iv) The written request by the bidder to withdraw or modify the bid, together with the bidder\'92s written statement\
and supporting evidence.\
(v) A written statement by the contracting officer setting forth-\
(A) A description of the supplies or services involved;\
(B) The expiration date of the bid in question and of the other bids submitted;\
(C) Specific information as to how and when the mistake was alleged;\
(D) A summary of the evidence submitted by the bidder;\
(E) In the event only one bid was received, a quotation of the most recent contract price for the supplies or\
services involved or, in the absence of a recent comparable contract, the contracting officer\'92s estimate of a fair price for the supplies or services;\
(F) Any additional pertinent evidence; and\
(G) A recommendation that either the bid be considered for award in the form submitted, or the bidder be authorized to withdraw or modify the bid.\
(4) Where the bidder fails or refuses to furnish evidence in support of a suspected or alleged mistake, the contracting officer shall consider the bid as submitted unless (i) the amount of the bid is so far out of line with the amounts of other bids received, or with the amount estimated by the agency or determined by the contracting officer to be reasonable, or (ii) there are other indications of error so clear, as to reasonably justify the conclusion that acceptance of the bid would be unfair to the bidder or to other bona fide bidders. Attempts made to obtain the information required and the action taken with respect to the bid shall be fully documented.\
(h) Each agency shall maintain records of all determinations made in accordance with this subsection \cf3 14.407-3\cf4 , the facts involved, and the action taken in each case. Copies of all such determinations shall be included in the file.\
(i) Nothing contained in this subsection \cf3 14.407-3 \cf4 prevents an agency from submitting doubtful cases to the Comptroller General for advance decision.\

\f0\b 14.407-4 Mistakes after award.\

\f1\b0 If a contractor\'92s discovery and request for correction of a mistake in bid is not made until after the award, it shall be processed under the procedures of \cf3 subpart 33.2 \cf4 and the following:\
(a) When a mistake in a contractor\'92s bid is not discovered until after award, the mistake may be corrected by contract modification if correcting the mistake would be favorable to the Government without changing the essential requirements of the specifications.\
(b) In addition to the cases contemplated in paragraph (a) of this section or as otherwise authorized by law, agencies are authorized to make a determination-\

(A) Describing the supplies or services involved;\

(C) Summarizing the evidence submitted by the contractor and any additional evidence considered pertinent;\
(D) Quoting, in cases where only one bid was received, the most recent contract price for the supplies or services\
involved, or in the absence of a recent comparable contract, the contracting officer\'92s estimate of a fair price for the supplies or services and the basis for the estimate;\

14.408-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall make a contract award (1) by written or electronic notice, (2) within the time for acceptance specified in the bid or an extension (see \cf3 14.404-1\cf4 (d)), and (3) to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors (see \cf3 14.201-8\cf4 ) included in the invitation. Award shall not be made until all required approvals have been obtained and the award otherwise conforms with \cf3 14.103-2\cf4 .\
(b) If less than three bids have been received, the contracting officer shall examine the situation to ascertain the reasons for the small number of responses. Award shall be made notwithstanding the limited number of bids. However, the contracting officer shall initiate, if appropriate, corrective action to increase competition in future solicitations for the same or similar items, and include a notation of such action in the records of the invitation for bids (see \cf3 14.204\cf4 ).\
(c) (1) Award shall be made by mailing or otherwise furnishing a properly executed award document to the successful bidder.\
(2) When a notice of award is issued, it shall be followed as soon as possible by the formal award.\
(3) When more than one award results from any single invitation for bids, separate award documents shall be suitably numbered and executed.\
(4) When an award is made to a bidder for less than all of the items that may be awarded to that bidder and additional items are being withheld for subsequent award, the award shall state that the Government may make subsequent awards on those additional items within the bid acceptance period.\
(5) All provisions of the invitation for bids, including any acceptable additions or changes made by a bidder in the bid, shall be clearly and accurately set forth (either expressly or by reference) in the award document. The award is an acceptance of the bid, and the bid and the award constitute the contract.\
(d) (1) Award is generally made by using the Award portion of \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 33\cf4 , Solicitation, Offer, and Award, or \cf3 SF 1447\cf4 , Solicitation/Contract (see \cf3 53.214\cf4 ). If an offer from a \cf3 SF 33 \cf4 leads to further changes, the resulting contract shall be prepared as a bilateral document on \cf3 SF 26\cf4 , Award/Contract.\
(2) Use of the Award portion of \cf3 SF 33\cf4 , \cf3 SF 26\cf4 , or \cf3 SF 1447\cf4 , does not preclude the additional use of informal documents, including electronic transmissions, as notices of awards.\

\f0\b 14.408-2 Responsible bidder-reasonableness of price.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall determine that a prospective contractor is responsible (see \cf3 subpart 9.1\cf4 ) and that the prices offered are reasonable before awarding the contract. The price analysis techniques in \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (b) may be used as guidelines. In each case the determination shall be made in the light of all prevailing circumstances. Particular care must be taken in cases where only a single bid is received.\
(b) The price analysis shall consider whether bids are materially unbalanced (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (g)).\

\f0\b 14.408-3 Prompt payment discounts.\

\f1\b0 (a) Prompt payment discounts shall not be considered in the evaluation of bids. However, any discount offered will form a part of the award, and will be taken by the payment center if payment is made within the discount period specified by\
the bidder. As an alternative to indicating a discount in conjunction with the offer, bidders may prefer to offer discounts on individual invoices.\
(b) See \cf3 32.111\cf4 (b)(1), which prescribes the contract clause at \cf3 52.232-8\cf4 , Discounts for Prompt Payment.\

\f0\b 14.408-4 Economic price adjustment.\

\f1\b0 (a) Bidder proposes economic price adjustment. (1) When a solicitation does not contain an economic price adjustment clause but a bidder proposes one with a ceiling that the price will not exceed, the bid shall be evaluated on the basis of the maximum possible economic price adjustment of the quoted base price.\
(2) If the bid is eligible for award, the contracting officer shall request the bidder to agree to the inclusion in the award of an approved economic price adjustment clause (see \cf3 16.203\cf4 ) that is subject to the same ceiling. If the bidder will not agree to an approved clause, the award may be made on the basis of the bid as originally submitted.\
(3) Bids that contain economic price adjustments with no ceiling shall be rejected unless a clear basis for evaluation exists.\

\f1\b0 (b) Government proposes economic price adjustment. (1) When an invitation contains an economic price adjustment clause and no bidder takes exception to the provisions, bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the quoted prices without the allowable economic price adjustment being added.\
(2) When a bidder increases the maximum percentage of economic price adjustment stipulated in the invitation or limits the downward economic price adjustment provisions of the invitation, the bid shall be rejected as nonresponsive.\
(3) When a bid indicates deletion of the economic price adjustment clause, the bid shall be rejected as nonresponsive since the downward economic price adjustment provisions are thereby limited.\
(4) When a bidder decreases the maximum percentage of economic price adjustment stipulated in the invitation, the bid shall be evaluated at the base price on an equal basis with bids that do not reduce the stipulated ceiling. However, after evaluation, if the bidder offering the lower ceiling is in a position to receive the award, the award shall reflect the lower ceiling.\

\f0\b 14.408-5 [Reserved]\
14.408-6 Equal low bids.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracts shall be awarded in the following order of priority when two or more low bids are equal in all respects: (1) Small business concerns that are also labor surplus area concerns.\
(2) Other small business concerns.\
(3) Other business concerns.\
(b) If two or more bidders still remain equally eligible after application of paragraph (a) of this section, award shall be made by a drawing by lot limited to those bidders. If time permits, the bidders involved shall be given an opportunity to attend the drawing. The drawing shall be witnessed by at least three persons, and the contract file shall contain the names and addresses of the witnesses and the person supervising the drawing.\
(c) When an award is to be made by using the priorities under this \cf3 14.408-6\cf4 , the contracting officer shall include a written agreement in the contract that the contractor will perform, or cause to be performed, the contract in accordance with the circumstances justifying the priority used to break the tie or select bids for a drawing by lot.\

\f0\b 14.408-7 Documentation of award.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall document compliance with \cf3 14.103-2 \cf4 in the contract file.\
(b) The documentation shall either state that the accepted bid was the lowest bid received, or list all lower bids with reasons for their rejection in sufficient detail to justify the award.\
(c) When an award is made after receipt of equal low bids, the documentation shall describe how the tie was broken.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The contracting officer shall as a minimum (subject to any restrictions in \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 )-\
(i) Notify each unsuccessful bidder in writing or electronically within threedays after contract award, that its bid was\
not accepted. "Day," for purposes of the notification process, means calendar day, except that the period will run until a day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday;\
(ii) Extend appreciation for the interest the unsuccessful bidder has shown in submitting a bid; and\
(iii) When award is made to other than a low bidder, state the reason for rejection in the notice to each of the unsuccessful low bidders.\
(2) For acquisitions covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or a Free Trade Agreement (see \cf3 25.408\cf4 (a)(5)), agencies must include in notices given unsuccessful bidders from World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or Free Trade Agreement countries-\
(i) The dollar amount of the successful bid; and\
(ii) The name and address of the successful bidder.\
(b) Information included in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection shall be provided to any unsuccessful bidder upon request\

(c) When a request is received concerning an unclassified invitation from an inquirer who is neither a bidder nor a representative of a bidder, the contracting officer should make every effort to furnish the names of successful bidders and, if requested, the prices at which awards were made. However, when such requests require so much work as to interfere with the normal operations of the contracting office, the inquirer will be advised where a copy of the abstract of offers may be seen.\
(d) Requests for records shall be governed by agency regulations implementing \cf3 subpart 24.2\cf4 .\

\f0\b 14.409-2 Award of classified contracts.\

\f1\b0 In addition to \cf3 14.409-1\cf4 , if classified information was furnished or created in connection with the solicitation, the contracting officer shall advise the unsuccessful bidders, including any who did not bid, to take disposition action\
in accordance with agency procedures. The name of the successful bidder and the contract price will be furnished to unsuccessful bidders only upon request. Information regarding a classified award shall not be furnished by telephone.\

\fs24 Subpart 14.5 - Two-Step Sealed Bidding\

\fs20 14.501 General.\

\f1\b0 Two-step sealed bidding is a combination of competitive procedures designed to obtain the benefits of sealed bidding when adequate specifications are not available. An objective is to permit the development of a sufficiently descriptive and not unduly restrictive statement of the Government\'92s requirements, including an adequate technical data package, so that subsequent acquisitions may be made by conventional sealed bidding. This method is especially useful in acquisitions requiring technical proposals, particularly those for complex items. It is conducted in two steps:\
(a) Step one consists of the request for, submission, evaluation, and (if necessary) discussion of a technical proposal.\
No pricing is involved. The objective is to determine the acceptability of the supplies or services offered. As used in this context, the word "technical" has a broad connotation and includes, among other things, the engineering approach, special manufacturing processes, and special testing techniques. It is the proper step for clarification of questions relating to technical requirements. Conformity to the technical requirements is resolved in this step, but not responsibility as defined in \cf3 9.1\cf4 .\
(b) Step two involves the submission of sealed priced bids by those who submitted acceptable technical proposals in step one. Bids submitted in step two are evaluated and the awards made in accordance with \cf3 subparts 14.3 \cf4 and \cf3 14.4\cf4 .\

\f0\b 14.502 Conditions for use.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unless other factors require the use of sealed bidding, two-step sealed bidding may be used in preference to negotiation when all of the following conditions are present:\
(1) Available specifications or purchase descriptions are not definite or complete or may be too restrictive without technical evaluation, and any necessary discussion, of the technical aspects of the requirement to ensure mutual understanding between each source and the Government.\
(2) Definite criteria exist for evaluating technical proposals\
(3) More than one technically qualified source is expected to be available.\
(4) Sufficient time will be available for use of the two-step method.\
(5) A firm-fixed-price contract or a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment will be used.\
(b) None of the following precludes the use of two-step sealed bidding: (1) Multi-year contracting.\
(2) Government property to be made available to the successful bidder. (3) A total small business set-aside (see \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 ).\
(4) The use of a set-aside or price evaluation preference for HUBZone small business concerns (see \cf3 subpart 19.13\cf4 ). (5) The use of a set-aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (see \cf3 subpart 19.14\cf4 ).\
(6) The use of a set-aside for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concerns and women-owned\
small business concerns eligible under the Women-Owned Small Business Program (see \cf3 subpart 19.15\cf4 ). (7) A first or subsequent production quantity is being acquired under a performance specification.\

\f0\b 14.503 Procedures.\
14.503-1 Step one.\

\f1\b0 (a) Requests for technical proposals shall be synopsized in accordance with \cf3 part 5\cf4 . The request must include, as a minimum, the following:\
(1) A description of the supplies or services required.\
(2) A statement of intent to use the two-step method.\
(3) The requirements of the technical proposal.\
(4) The evaluation criteria, to include all factors and any significant subfactors.\
(5) A statement that the technical proposals shall not include prices or pricing information. (6) The date, or date and hour, by which the proposal must be received (see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (r)). (7) A statement that-\
(i) In the second step, only bids based upon technical proposals determined to be acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for awards, and\
(ii) Each bid in the second step must be based on the bidder\'92s own technical proposals. (8) A statement that-\
(i) Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information,\

\f1\b0 F
\fs16 EDERAL 
\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (ii) The Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal\'92s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted; and\
(iii) The Government may proceed with the second step without requesting further information from any offeror; however, the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, and may discuss proposals with their offerors.\
(9) A statement that a notice of unacceptability will be forwarded to the offeror upon completion of the proposal evaluation and final determination of unacceptability.\
(10) A statement either that only one technical proposal may be submitted by each offeror or that multiple technical proposals may be submitted. When specifications permit different technical approaches, it is generally in the Government\'92s interest to authorize multiple proposals. If multiple proposals are authorized, see \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (s).\
(b) Information on delivery or performance requirements may be of assistance to bidders in determining whether or not to submit a proposal and may be included in the request. The request shall also indicate that the information is not binding on the Government and that the actual delivery or performance requirements will be contained in the invitation issued under step two.\
(c) Upon receipt, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Safeguard proposals against disclosure to unauthorized persons;\
(2) Accept and handle data marked in accordance with \cf3 15.609 \cf4 as provided in that section; and (3) Remove any reference to price or cost.\
(d) The contracting officer shall establish a time period for evaluating technical proposals. The period may vary with the complexity and number of proposals involved. However, the evaluation should be completed quickly.\
(e) (1) Evaluations shall be based on the criteria in the request for proposals but not consideration of responsibility as defined in \cf3 9.1\cf4 , Proposals, shall be categorized as-\
(i) Acceptable;\
(ii) Reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable; or (iii) Unacceptable.\
(2) Any proposal which modifies, or fails to conform to the essential requirements or specifications of, the request for technical proposals shall be considered nonresponsive and categorized as unacceptable.\
(f) (1) The contracting officer may proceed directly with step two if there are sufficient acceptable proposals to ensure adequate price competition under step two, and if further time, effort and delay to make additional proposals acceptable and thereby increase competition would not be in the Government\'92s interest. If this is not the case, the contracting officer shall request bidders whose proposals may be made acceptable to submit additional clarifying or supplementing information. The contracting office shall identify the nature of the deficiencies in the proposal or the nature of the additional information required. The contracting officer may also arrange discussions for this purpose. No proposal shall be discussed with any offeror other than the submitter.\
(2) In initiating requests for additional information, the contracting officer shall fix an appropriate time for bidders to conclude discussions, if any, submit all additional information, and incorporate such additional information as part of their proposals submitted. Such time may be extended in the discretion of the contracting officer. If the additional information incorporated as part of a proposal within the final time fixed by the contracting officer establishes that the proposal is acceptable, it shall be so categorized. Otherwise, it shall be categorized as unacceptable.\
(g) When a technical proposal is found unacceptable (either initially or after clarification), the contracting officer shall promptly notify the offeror of the basis of the determination and that a revision of the proposal will not be considered. Upon written request, the contracting officer shall debrief unsuccessful offerors (see \cf3 15.505 \cf4 and \cf3 15.506\cf4 ).\
(h) Late technical proposals are governed by \cf3 15.208\cf4 (b), (c), and (f).\
(i) If it is necessary to discontinue two-step sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall include a statement of the facts and circumstances in the contract file. Each offeror shall be notified in writing. When step one results in no acceptable technical proposal or only one acceptable technical proposal, the acquisition may be continued by negotiation.\

\f0\b 14.503-2 Step two.\

\f1\b0 (a) Sealed bidding procedures shall be followed except that invitations for bids shall-\
(1) Be issued only to those offerors submitting acceptable technical proposals in step one;\
(2) Include the provision prescribed in \cf3 14.201-6\cf4 (t);\
(3) Prominently state that the bidder shall comply with the specifications and the bidder\'92s technical proposal; and\

\f0\b\fs20 15.101-2\
 15.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures governing competitive and noncompetitive negotiated acquisitions. A contract awarded using other than sealed bidding procedures is a negotiated contract (see \cf3 14.101\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 15.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Deficiency 
\f1\i0 is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.\

\f2\i Proposal modification 
\f1\i0 is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.\

\f2\i Proposal revision 
\f1\i0 is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a contracting officer, as the result of negotiations.\

\f2\i Weakness 
\f1\i0 means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.\

\f0\b 15.002 Types of negotiated acquisition.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Sole source acquisitions. 
\f1\i0 When contracting in a sole source environment, the request for proposals (RFP) should be tailored to remove unnecessary information and requirements; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 evaluation criteria and voluminous proposal preparation instructions.\
(b) 
\f2\i Competitive acquisitions
\f1\i0 . When contracting in a competitive environment, the procedures of this part are intended to minimize the complexity of the solicitation, the evaluation, and the source selection decision, while maintaining a process designed to foster an impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors\'92 proposals, leading to selection of the proposal representing the best value to the Government (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ).\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 15.1 - Source Selection Processes and Techniques\

\fs20 15.100 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart describes some of the acquisition processes and techniques that may be used to design competitive acquisition strategies suitable for the specific circumstances of the acquisition.\

\f0\b 15.101 Best value continuum.\

\f1\b0 An agency can obtain best value in negotiated acquisitions by using any one or a combination of source selection approaches. In different types of acquisitions, the relative importance of cost or price may vary. For example, in acquisitions where the requirement is clearly definable and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, cost or price may play a dominant role in source selection. The less definitive the requirement, the more development work required, or the greater the performance risk, the more technical or past performance considerations may play a dominant role in source selection.\

\f0\b 15.101-1 Tradeoff process.\

\f1\b0 (a) A tradeoff process is appropriate when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.\
(b) When using a tradeoff process, the following apply:\
(1) All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance shall be\
clearly stated in the solicitation; and\
(2) The solicitation shall state whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly\
more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price.\
(c) This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other\
than the lowest priced proposal. The perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal shall merit the additional cost, and the rationale for tradeoffs must be documented in the file in accordance with \cf3 15.406\cf4 .\

\f0\b 15.101-2 Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.\

\f1\b0 (a) The lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.\

\fs20 (b) When using the lowest price technically acceptable process, the following apply:\
(1) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth\
in the solicitation. Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to \cf3 15.304\cf4 (c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with \cf3 15.305\cf4 . However, the comparative assessment in \cf3 15.305\cf4 (a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business\'92 past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in \cf3 subpart 19.6 \cf4 and \cf3 15 U.S.C.637(b) (7)\cf4 ).\
(2) Tradeoffs are not permitted.\
(3) Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. (4) Exchanges may occur (see \cf3 15.306\cf4 ).\
(c) Except for DoD, in accordance with section 880 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Pub. L. 115-232, 41 U.S.C. 3701 Note), the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process shall only be used when\'97\
(1) The agency can comprehensively and clearly describe the minimum requirements in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine the acceptability of offers;\
(2) The agency would realize no, or minimal, value from a proposal that exceeds the minimum technical or performance requirements;\
(3) The agency believes the technical proposals will require no, or minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority as to the desirability of one offeror's proposal versus a competing proposal;\
(4) The agency has a high degree of confidence that reviewing the technical proposals of all offerors would not result in the identification of characteristics that could provide value or benefit to the agency;\
(5) The agency determined that the lowest price reflects the total cost, including operation and support, of the product(s) or service(s) being acquired; and\
(6) The contracting officer documents the contract file describing the circumstances that justify the use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.\
(d) Except for DoD, in accordance with section 880 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Pub. L. 115-232, 41 U.S.C. 3701 Note), contracting officers shall avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process in the case of a procurement that is predominantly for the acquisition of\'97\
(1) Information technology services, cybersecurity services, systems engineering and technical assistance services, advanced electronic testing, audit or audit readiness services, health care services and records, telecommunications devices and services, or other knowledge-based professional services;\
(2) Personal protective equipment; or\
(3) Knowledge-based training or logistics services in contingency operations or other operations outside the United States, including in Afghanistan or Iraq.\

\f0\b 15.101-3 Tiered evaluation of small business offers.\

\f1\b0 An agency shall not create a tiered (or "cascading") evaluation of offers, as described in \cf3 13 CFR 125.2\cf4 , for multiple-award contracts unless an agency has statutory authority.\

\f0\b 15.102 Oral presentations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Oral presentations by offerors as requested by the Government may substitute for, or augment, written information. Use of oral presentations as a substitute for portions of a proposal can be effective in streamlining the source selection process. Oral presentations may occur at any time in the acquisition process, and are subject to the same restrictions as written information, regarding timing (see \cf3 15.208\cf4 ) and content (see \cf3 15.306\cf4 ). Oral presentations provide an opportunity for dialogue among the parties. Pre-recorded videotaped presentations that lack real-time interactive dialogue are not considered oral presentations for the purposes of this section, although they may be included in offeror submissions, when appropriate.\
(b) The solicitation may require each offeror to submit part of its proposal through oral presentations. However, representations and certifications shall be submitted as required in the FAR provisions at \cf3 52.204-8\cf4 (d) or \cf3 52.212-3\cf4 (b), and a signed offer sheet (including any exceptions to the Government\'92s terms and conditions) shall be submitted in writing.\

\f1\b0 (c) Information pertaining to areas such as an offeror\'92s capability, past performance, work plans or approaches, staffing resources, transition plans, or sample tasks (or other types of tests) may be suitable for oral presentations. In deciding what information to obtain through an oral presentation, consider the following:\
(1) The Government\'92s ability to adequately evaluate the information;\
(2) The need to incorporate any information into the resultant contract;\
(3) The impact on the efficiency of the acquisition; and\
(4) The impact (including cost) on small businesses. In considering the costs of oral presentations, contracting officers\
should also consider alternatives to on-site oral presentations (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 teleconferencing, video teleconferencing).\
(d) When oral presentations are required, the solicitation shall provide offerors with sufficient information to prepare them.\
Accordingly, the solicitation may describe-\
(1) The types of information to be presented orally and the associated evaluation factors that will be used;\
(2) The qualifications for personnel that will be required to provide the oral presentation(s);\
(3) The requirements for, and any limitations and/or prohibitions on, the use of written material or other media to\
supplement the oral presentations;\
(4) The location, date, and time for the oral presentations;\
(5) The restrictions governing the time permitted for each oral presentation; and\
(6) The scope and content of exchanges that may occur between the Government\'92s participants and the offeror\'92s\
representatives as part of the oral presentations, including whether or not discussions (see \cf3 15.306\cf4 (d)) will be permitted during oral presentations.\
(e) The contracting officer shall maintain a record of oral presentations to document what the Government relied upon in making the source selection decision. The method and level of detail of the record (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 videotaping, audio tape recording, written record, Government notes, copies of offeror briefing slides or presentation notes) shall be at the discretion of the source selection authority. A copy of the record placed in the file may be provided to the offeror.\
(f) When an oral presentation includes information that the parties intend to include in the contract as material terms or conditions, the information shall be put in writing. Incorporation by reference of oral statements is not permitted.\
(g) If, during an oral presentation, the Government conducts discussions (see \cf3 15.306\cf4 (d)), the Government must comply with \cf3 15.306 \cf4 and \cf3 15.307\cf4 .\

\fs24 Subpart 15.2 - Solicitation and Receipt of Proposals and Information\

\fs20 15.200 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for-\
(a) Exchanging information with industry prior to receipt of proposals;\
(b) Preparing and issuing requests for proposals (RFPs) and requests for information (RFIs); and (c) Receiving proposals and information.\

\f0\b 15.201 Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals.\

\f1\b0 (a) Exchanges of information among all interested parties, from the earliest identification of a requirement through receipt of proposals, are encouraged. Any exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements (see \cf3 3.104\cf4 ). Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.\
(b) The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government\'92s requirements, and enhancing the Government\'92s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.\
(c) Agencies are encouraged to promote early exchanges of information about future acquisitions. An early exchange of information among industry and the program manager, contracting officer, and other participants in the acquisition process can identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type, terms and conditions, and acquisition planning schedules; the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requirements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach\
for assessing past performance information; the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions. Some techniques to promote early exchanges of information are-\
(1) Industry or small business conferences;\
(2) Public hearings;\
(3) Market research, as described in \cf3 part 10\cf4 ;\
(4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors (any that are substantially involved with potential contract terms and\
conditions should include the contracting officer; also see paragraph (f) of this section regarding restrictions on disclosure of information);\
(5) Presolicitation notices;\
(6) Draft RFPs;\
(7) RFIs;\
(8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences; and (9) Site visits.\
(d) The special notices of procurement matters at \cf3 5.205\cf4 (c), or electronic notices, may be used to publicize the Government\'92s requirement or solicit information from industry.\
(e) RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. There is no required format for RFIs.\
(f) General information about agency mission needs and future requirements may be disclosed at any time. After release of the solicitation, the contracting officer must be the focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or\
more potential offerors, that information must be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a potential offeror in response to its request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror\'92s confidential business strategy, and is protected under \cf3 3.104 \cf4 or \cf3 subpart 24.2\cf4 . When conducting a presolicitation or preproposal conference, materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all potential offerors, upon request.\

\f0\b 15.202 Advisory multi-step process.\

\f1\b0 (a) The agency may publish a presolicitation notice (see \cf3 5.204\cf4 ) that provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and invites potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The presolicitation notice should identify the information that must be submitted\

\fs20 and the criteria that will be used in making the initial evaluation. Information sought may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 proposed technical concept, past performance, and limited pricing information). At a minimum, the notice shall contain sufficient information to permit a potential offeror to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. This process should not be used for multi-step acquisitions where it would result in offerors being required to submit identical information in response to the notice and in response to the initial step of the acquisition.\
(b) The agency shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The agency shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.\

\f0\b 15.203 Requests for proposals.\

\f1\b0 (a) Requests for proposals (RFPs) are used in negotiated acquisitions to communicate Government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals. RFPs for competitive acquisitions shall, at a minimum, describe the-\
(1) Government\'92s requirement;\
(2) Anticipated terms and conditions that will apply to the contract. The solicitation may authorize offerors to propose alternative terms and conditions. If the solicitation permits offerors to submit one or more additional proposals with alternative line items (see \cf3 52.204-22 \cf4 or \cf3 52.212-1\cf4 (e)), the evaluation approach should consider the potential impact of the alternative line items on other terms and conditions or the requirement (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , place of performance or payment and funding requirements) (see \cf3 15.206\cf4 );\
(3) Information required to be in the offeror\'92s proposal; and\
(4) Factors and significant subfactors that will be used to evaluate the proposal and their relative importance.\
(b) An RFP may be issued for OMB CircularA-76 studies. See \cf3 subpart 7.3 \cf4 for additional information regarding cost\
comparisons between Government and contractor performance.\
(c) Electronic commerce may be used to issue RFPs and to receive proposals, modifications, and revisions. In this case,\
the RFP shall specify the electronic commerce method(s) that offerors may use (see \cf3 subpart 4.5\cf4 ).\
(d) Contracting officers may issue RFPs and/or authorize receipt of proposals, modifications, or revisions by facsimile.\
(1) In deciding whether or not to use facsimiles, the contracting officer should consider factors such as- (i) Anticipated proposal size and volume;\
(ii) Urgency of the requirement;\
(iii) Availability and suitability of electronic commerce methods; and\
(iv) Adequacy of administrative procedures and controls for receiving, identifying, recording, and safeguarding facsimile proposals, and ensuring their timely delivery to the designated proposal delivery location.\
(2) If facsimile proposals are authorized, contracting officers may request offeror(s) to provide the complete, original signed proposal at a later date.\
(e) Letter RFPs may be used in sole source acquisitions and other appropriate circumstances. Use of a letter RFP does not relieve the contracting officer from complying with other FAR requirements. Letter RFPs should be as complete as possible and, at a minimum, should contain the following:\
(1) RFP number and date;\
(2) Name, address (including electronic address and facsimile address, if appropriate), and telephone number of the contracting officer;\
(3) Type of contract contemplated;\
(4) Quantity, description, and required delivery dates for the item;\
(5) Applicable certifications and representations;\
(6) Anticipated contract terms and conditions;\
(7) Instructions to offerors and evaluation criteria for other than sole source actions;\
(8) Proposal due date and time; and\
(9) Other relevant information; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 incentives, variations in delivery schedule, cost proposal support, and data\
requirements.\
(f) Oral RFPs are authorized when processing a written solicitation would delay the acquisition of supplies or services to\
the detriment of the Government and a notice is not required under \cf3 5.202\cf4 (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 perishable items and support of contingency\

\f1\b0 operations or other emergency situations). Use of an oral RFP does not relieve the contracting officer from complying with other FAR requirements.\
(1) The contract files supporting oral solicitations should include-\
(i) A description of the requirement;\
(ii) Rationale for use of an oral solicitation;\
(iii) Sources solicited, including the date, time, name of individuals contacted, and prices offered; and (iv) The solicitation number provided to the prospective offerors.\
(2) The information furnished to potential offerors under oral solicitations should include appropriate items from paragraph (e) of this section.\

\f0\b 15.204 Contract format.\

\f1\b0 The use of a uniform contract format facilitates preparation of the solicitation and contract as well as reference to, and use of, those documents by offerors, contractors, and contract administrators. The uniform contract format need not be used for the following:\
(a) Construction and architect-engineer contracts (see \cf3 part 36\cf4 ).\
(b) Subsistence contracts.\
(c) Supplies or services contracts requiring special contract formats prescribed elsewhere in this regulation that are\
inconsistent with the uniform format.\
(d) Letter requests for proposals (see \cf3 15.203\cf4 (e)).\
(e) Contracts exempted by the agency head or designee.\

\f0\b 15.204-1 Uniform contract format.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers shall prepare solicitations and resulting contracts using the uniform contract format outlined in Table 15-1 of this subsection.\
(b) Solicitations using the uniform contract format shall include Parts I, II, III, and IV (see \cf3 15.204-2 \cf4 through \cf3 15.204-5\cf4 ). Upon award, contracting officers shall not physically include Part IV in the resulting contract, but shall retain it in the contract file. (See \cf3 4.1201\cf4 (c).) The representations and certifications are incorporated by reference in the contract by using \cf3 52.204-19 \cf4 (see \cf3 4.1202\cf4 (b)) or for acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services see \cf3 52.212-4\cf4 (v).\

\f1\b0 (a) When, either before or after receipt of proposals, the Government changes its requirements or terms and conditions, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation.\
(b) Amendments issued before the established time and date for receipt of proposals shall be issued to all parties receiving the solicitation.\
(c) Amendments issued after the established time and date for receipt of proposals shall be issued to all offerors that have not been eliminated from the competition.\
(d) If a proposal of interest to the Government involves a departure from the stated requirements, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation, provided this can be done without revealing to the other offerors the alternate solution proposed or any other information that is entitled to protection (see \cf3 15.207\cf4 (b) and \cf3 15.306\cf4 (e)).\
(e) If, in the judgment of the contracting officer, based on market research or otherwise, an amendment proposed for issuance after offers have been received is so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated, so that additional sources likely would have submitted offers had the substance of the amendment been known to them, the contracting officer shall cancel the original solicitation and issue a new one, regardless of the stage of the acquisition.\
(f) Oral notices may be used when time is of the essence. The contracting officer shall document the contract file and formalize the notice with an amendment (see \cf3 subpart 4.5\cf4 , Electronic Commerce in Contracting).\

\fs20 (c) If any portion of a proposal received by the contracting officer electronically or by facsimile is unreadable, the contracting officer immediately shall notify the offeror and permit the offeror to resubmit the unreadable portion of the proposal. The method and time for resubmission shall be prescribed by the contracting officer after consultation with the offeror, and documented in the file. The resubmission shall be considered as if it were received at the date and time of the original unreadable submission for the purpose of determining timeliness under \cf3 15.208\cf4 (a), provided the offeror complies with the time and format requirements for resubmission prescribed by the contracting officer.\

\f0\b 15.208 Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.\

\f1\i0 regular mail, electronic commerce, or facsimile). If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposals are due.\
(b) (1) Any proposal, modification, or revision, that is received at the designated Government office after the exact time specified for receipt of proposals is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the contracting officer determines that accepting the late proposal would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-\
(i) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or\
(ii) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of proposals and was under the Government\'92s control prior to the time set for receipt of proposals; or\
(iii) It was the only proposal received.\
(2) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal, that makes its terms more favorable to the\
Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.\
(c) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that\
installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.\
(d) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.\
(e) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. The contracting officer must document the contract file when oral withdrawals are made. One copy of withdrawn proposals should be retained in the contract file (see \cf3 4.803\cf4 (a)(10)). Extra copies of the withdrawn proposals may be destroyed or returned to the offeror at the offeror\'92s request. Where practicable, electronically transmitted proposals that are withdrawn must be purged from primary and backup data storage systems after a copy is made for the file. Extremely bulky proposals must only be returned at the offeror\'92s request and expense.\
(f) The contracting officer must promptly notify any offeror if its proposal, modification, or revision was received late, and must inform the offeror whether its proposal will be considered, unless contract award is imminent and the notice prescribed in \cf3 15.503\cf4 (b) would suffice.\
(g) Late proposals and modifications that are not considered must be held unopened, unless opened for identification, until after award and then retained with other unsuccessful proposals.\
(h) If available, the following must be included in the contracting office files for each late proposal, modification, revision, or withdrawal:\
(1) The date and hour of receipt.\
(2) A statement regarding whether the proposal was considered for award, with supporting rationale. (3) The envelope, wrapper, or other evidence of date of receipt.\

\f0\b 15.209 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 When contracting by negotiation-\

\fs24 Subpart 15.3 - Source Selection\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for selection of a source or sources in competitive negotiated acquisitions.\

\f0\b 15.301 [Reserved]\
15.302 Source selection objective.\

\f1\b0 The objective of source selection is to select the proposal that represents the best value.\

\f0\b 15.303 Responsibilities.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agency heads are responsible for source selection. The contracting officer is designated as the source selection authority, unless the agency head appoints another individual for a particular acquisition or group of acquisitions.\
(b) The source selection authority shall-\
(1) Establish an evaluation team, tailored for the particular acquisition, that includes appropriate contracting, legal,\
logistics, technical, and other expertise to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of offers;\
(2) Approve the source selection strategy or acquisition plan, if applicable, before solicitation release;\
(3) Ensure consistency among the solicitation requirements, notices to offerors, proposal preparation instructions,\
evaluation factors and subfactors, solicitation provisions or contract clauses, and data requirements;\
(4) Ensure that proposals are evaluated based solely on the factors and subfactors contained in the solicitation (\cf3 10\
U.S.C. 3303(c) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3703(c)\cf4 );\
(5) Consider the recommendations of advisory boards or panels (if any); and\
(6) Select the source or sources whose proposal is the best value to the Government (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3303(c) \cf4 and \cf3 41\
U.S.C.3703(c)\cf4 ).\
(c) The contracting officer shall-\
(1) After release of a solicitation, serve as the focal point for inquiries from actual or prospective offerors; (2) After receipt of proposals, control exchanges with offerors in accordance with \cf3 15.306\cf4 ; and\
(3) Award the contract(s).\

\f0\b 15.304 Evaluation factors and significant subfactors.\

\f1\b0 (a) The award decision is based on evaluation factors and significant subfactors that are tailored to the acquisition. (b) Evaluation factors and significant subfactors must-\
(1) Represent the key areas of importance and emphasis to be considered in the source selection decision; and\
(2) Support meaningful comparison and discrimination between and among competing proposals.\
(c) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that apply to an acquisition and their relative importance, are within\
the broad discretion of agency acquisition officials, subject to the following requirements:\
(1) (i) Price or cost to the Government shall be evaluated in every source selection (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(c)(1)(B) \cf4 and \cf3 41\
U.S.C.3306\cf4 (c)(1)(B)(also see part 36 for architect-engineer contracts), subject to the exception listed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) (A) of this section for use by DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.\
(ii) In accordance with \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(c)\cf4 , for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard\'97\
(A) The contracting officer may choose not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for award when a\
solicitation\'97\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Has an estimated value above the simplified acquisition threshold;\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Will result in multiple-award contracts (see subpart \cf3 16.5\cf4 ) that are for the same or similar services; and 
\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 States that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors (see 2.101).\
(B) If the contracting officer chooses not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for the contract award, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each order placed under the contract.\
(C) The exception in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall not apply to solicitations for multiple-award contracts that provide for sole source orders pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 637\cf4 (a)).\
(2) The quality of the product or service shall be addressed in every source selection through consideration of one or more non-cost evaluation factors such as past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence,\

(3) (i) Past performance, except as set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, shall be evaluated in all source selections for negotiated competitive acquisitions expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(ii) For solicitations that are not set aside for small business concerns, involving consolidation or bundling, that offer a significant opportunity for subcontracting, the contracting officer shall include a factor to evaluate past performance indicating the extent to which the offeror attained applicable goals for small business participation under contracts that required subcontracting plans (\cf3 15 U.S.C.637(d)(4)(G)(ii)\cf4 ).\
(iii) Past performance need not be evaluated if the contracting officer documents the reason past performance is not an appropriate evaluation factor for the acquisition.\
(4) For solicitations, that are not set aside for small business concerns, involving consolidation or bundling, that offer a significant opportunity for subcontracting, the contracting officer shall include proposed small business subcontracting participation in the subcontracting plan as an evaluation factor (\cf3 15 U.S.C.637(d)(4)(G)(i)\cf4 ).\
(5) If telecommuting is not prohibited, agencies shall not unfavorably evaluate an offer that includes telecommuting unless the contracting officer executes a written determination in accordance with FAR \cf3 7.108\cf4 (b).\

The rating method need not be disclosed in the solicitation. The general approach for evaluating past performance information shall be described.\
(e) Unless the exception at paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section applies, the solicitation shall also state, at a minimum, whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are\'97\
(1) Significantly more important than cost or price;\
(2) Approximately equal to cost or price; or\
(3) Significantly less important than cost or price (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3206(c)(1)(C) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3306(c)(1)(C)\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 15.305 Proposal evaluation.\

\f1\b0 (a) Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and the offeror\'92s ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. An agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then assess their relative qualities solely on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation. Evaluations may be conducted using any rating method or combination of methods, including color or adjectival ratings, numerical weights, and ordinal rankings. The relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks supporting proposal evaluation shall be documented in the contract file.\
(1) 
\f2\i Cost or price evaluation
\f1\i0 . Normally, competition establishes price reasonableness. Therefore, when contracting on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis, comparison of the proposed prices will usually satisfy the requirement to perform a price analysis, and a cost analysis need not be performed. In limited situations, a cost analysis may be appropriate to establish reasonableness of the otherwise successful offeror's price (see \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(1)(i) (C)). When contracting on a cost-reimbursement basis, evaluations shall include a cost realism analysis to determine what the Government should realistically expect to pay for the proposed effort, the offeror's understanding of the work, and the offeror's ability to perform the contract. Cost realism analyses may also be used on fixed-price incentive contracts or, in exceptional cases, on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (d)(3)). (See \cf3 37.115 \cf4 for uncompensated overtime evaluation.) The contracting officer shall document the cost or price evaluation.\
(2) Past performance evaluation. (i) Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror\'92s ability to perform\
the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor\'92s performance shall be considered. This comparative assessment of past performance information is separate from the responsibility determination required under \cf3 subpart 9.1\cf4 .\
(ii) The solicitation shall describe the approach for evaluating past performance, including evaluating offerors with no relevant performance history, and shall provide offerors an opportunity to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement. The solicitation shall also authorize offerors to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror\'92s corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror\'92s past performance. The source selection authority shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information.\
(iii) The evaluation should take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.\

\f0\b\fs20 15.306\
 
\f1\b0 (iv) In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.\
(v) The evaluation should include the past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns (see \cf3 subpart 19.7\cf4 ).\
(vi) For offerors that are joint ventures, the evaluation shall take into account past performance of the joint venture. If the joint venture does not demonstrate past performance for award, the contracting officer shall consider the past performance of each party to the joint venture.\
(3) 
\f2\i Technical evaluation
\f1\i0 . When tradeoffs are performed (see \cf3 15.101-1\cf4 ), the source selection records shall include- (i) An assessment of each offeror\'92s ability to accomplish the technical requirements; and\
(ii) A summary, matrix, or quantitative ranking, along with appropriate supporting narrative, of each technical\
proposal using the evaluation factors.\
(4) 
\f2\i Cost information. 
\f1\i0 Cost information may be provided to members of the technical evaluation team in accordance\
with agency procedures.\
(5) S
\f2\i mall business subcontracting evaluation. 
\f1\i0 Solicitations must be structured to give offers from small business\
concerns the highest rating for the evaluation factors in \cf3 15.304\cf4 (c)(3)(ii) and (c)(4).\
(b) The source selection authority may reject all proposals received in response to a solicitation, if doing so is in the best\
interest of the Government.\
(c) For restrictions on the use of support contractor personnel in proposal evaluation, see \cf3 37.203\cf4 (d).\

\f0\b 15.306 Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals.\

\f1\b0 (a) Clarifications and award without discussions. (1) Clarifications are limited exchanges, between the Government and offerors, that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.\
(2) If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 the relevance of an offeror\'92s past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors.\
(3) Award may be made without discussions if the solicitation states that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions. If the solicitation contains such a notice and the Government determines it is necessary to conduct discussions, the rationale for doing so shall be documented in the contract file (see the provision at \cf3 52.215-1\cf4 ) (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3303(a)(2) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3703(a)(2)\cf4 ).\
(b) 
\f2\i Communications with offerors before establishment of the competitive range
\f1\i0 . Communications are exchanges, between the Government and offerors, after receipt of proposals, leading to establishment of the competitive range. If a competitive range is to be established, these communications-\
(1) Shall be limited to the offerors described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section and-\
(i) Shall be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from\
being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond; and\
(ii) May only be held with those offerors (other than offerors under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain;\
(2) May be conducted to enhance Government understanding of proposals; allow reasonable interpretation of the proposal; or facilitate the Government\'92s evaluation process. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or material omissions, materially alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal. Such communications may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range;\
(3) Are for the purpose of addressing issues that must be explored to determine whether a proposal should be placed in the competitive range. Such communications shall not provide an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal, but may address-\
(i) Ambiguities in the proposal or other concerns (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 perceived deficiencies, weaknesses, errors, omissions, or mistakes (see \cf3 14.407\cf4 )); and\
(ii) Information relating to relevant past performance; and\
(4) Shall address adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to\
comment.\
(c) Competitive range. (1) Agencies shall evaluate all proposals in accordance with \cf3 15.305\cf4 (a), and, if discussions are\
to be conducted, establish the competitive range. Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the\

\fs20 contracting officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\
(2) After evaluating all proposals in accordance with \cf3 15.305\cf4 (a) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the contracting officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. Provided the solicitation notifies offerors that the competitive range can be limited for purposes of efficiency (see \cf3 52.215-1\cf4 (f)(4)), the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3303 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3703\cf4 ).\
(3) If the contracting officer, after complying with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, decides that an offeror\'92s proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal shall be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offerors in accordance with \cf3 15.503\cf4 .\
(4) Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing (see \cf3 15.505 \cf4 and \cf3 15.506\cf4 ).\
(d) 
\f2\i Exchanges with offerors after establishment of the competitive range
\f1\i0 . Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source environment, between the Government and offerors, that are undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal. These negotiations may include bargaining. Bargaining includes persuasion, alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract. When negotiations are conducted in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment of the competitive range and are called discussions.\
(1) Discussions are tailored to each offeror\'92s proposal, and must be conducted by the contracting officer with each offeror within the competitive range.\
(2) The primary objective of discussions is to maximize the Government\'92s ability to obtain best value, based on the requirement and the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.\
(3) At a minimum, the contracting officer must, subject to paragraphs (d)(5) and (e) of this section and \cf3 15.307\cf4 (a), indicate to, or discuss with, each offeror still being considered for award, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond. The contracting officer also is encouraged to discuss other aspects of the offeror\'92s proposal that could, in the opinion of the contracting officer, be altered or explained to enhance materially the proposal\'92s potential for award. However, the contracting officer is not required to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved. The scope and extent of discussions are a matter of contracting officer judgment.\
(4) In discussing other aspects of the proposal, the Government may, in situations where the solicitation stated that evaluation credit would be given for technical solutions exceeding any mandatory minimums, negotiate with offerors for increased performance beyond any mandatory minimums, and the Government may suggest to offerors that have exceeded any mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design), that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses were removed and the offered price decreased.\
(5) If, after discussions have begun, an offeror originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated offerors being considered for award, that offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision (see \cf3 15.307\cf4 (a) and \cf3 15.503\cf4 (a)(1)).\
(e) 
\f2\i Limits on exchanges
\f1\i0 . Government personnel involved in the acquisition shall not engage in conduct that- (1) Favors one offeror over another;\
(2) Reveals an offeror's technical solution, including\'97\
(i) Unique technology;\
(ii) Innovative and unique uses of commercial products or commercial services; or\
(iii) Any information that would compromise an offeror's intellectual property to another offeror;\
(3) Reveals an offeror\'92s price without that offeror\'92s permission. However, the contracting officer may inform an offeror that its price is considered by the Government to be too high, or too low, and reveal the results of the analysis supporting\
that conclusion. It is also permissible, at the Government\'92s discretion, to indicate to all offerors the cost or price that the Government\'92s price analysis, market research, and other reviews have identified as reasonable (\cf3 41 U.S.C.2102 \cf4 and 2107);\
(4) Reveals the names of individuals providing reference information about an offeror\'92s past performance; or (5) Knowingly furnishes source selection information in violation of \cf3 3.104 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.2102 \cf4 and 2107).\

 15.307 Proposal revisions.\

\f1\b0 (a) If an offeror\'92s proposal is eliminated or otherwise removed from the competitive range, no further revisions to that offeror\'92s proposal shall be accepted or considered.\
(b) The contracting officer may request or allow proposal revisions to clarify and document understandings reached during negotiations. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range shall be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision. The contracting officer is required to establish a common cut-off date only for receipt of final proposal revisions. Requests for final proposal revisions shall advise offerors that the final proposal revisions shall be in writing and that the Government intends to make award without obtaining further revisions.\

\f0\b 15.308 Source selection decision.\

\f1\b0 The source selection authority\'92s (SSA) decision shall be based on a comparative assessment of proposals against all\
source selection criteria in the solicitation. While the SSA may use reports and analyses prepared by others, the source selection decision shall represent the SSA\'92s independent judgment. The source selection decision shall be documented,\
and the documentation shall include the rationale for any business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on by the SSA, including benefits associated with additional costs. Although the rationale for the selection decision must be documented, that documentation need not quantify the tradeoffs that led to the decision.\

\f1\i0 (except as used in \cf3 15.407-2\cf4 ) also includes a transfer of commercial products or commercial services between\
divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or a subcontractor (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3701(2) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3501(a)(3)\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 15.402 Pricing policy.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers shall-\
(a) Purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. In establishing the reasonableness of the offered prices, the contracting officer-\
(1) Shall obtain certified cost or pricing data when required by \cf3 15.403-4\cf4 , along with data other than certified cost or pricing data as necessary to establish a fair and reasonable price; or\
(2) When certified cost or pricing data are not required by \cf3 15.403-4\cf4 , shall obtain data other than certified cost or pricing data as necessary to establish a fair and reasonable price, generally using the following order of preference in determining the type of data required:\
(i) No additional data from the offeror, if the price is based on adequate price competition, except as provided by \cf3 15.403-3\cf4 (b).\
(ii) Data other than certified cost or pricing data such as-\
(A) Data related to prices (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , established catalog or market prices, sales to non-governmental and governmental\
entities), relying first on data available within the Government; second, on data obtained from sources other than the offeror; and, if necessary, on data obtained from the offeror. When obtaining data from the offeror is necessary, unless an exception under \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b)(1) or (2) applies, such data submitted by the offeror shall include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.\
(B) Cost data to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine a fair and reasonable price.\
(3) Obtain the type and quantity of data necessary to establish a fair and reasonable price, but not more data than is\
necessary. Requesting unnecessary data can lead to increased proposal preparation costs, generally extend acquisition lead time, and consume additional contractor and Government resources. Use techniques such as, but not limited to, price analysis, cost analysis, and/or cost realism analysis to establish a fair and reasonable price. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be established by the contracting officer from the analyses of the data obtained or submitted to date, the contracting officer shall require the submission of additional data sufficient for the contracting officer to support the determination of the fair and reasonable price.\
(b) Price each contract separately and independently and not-\
(1) Use proposed price reductions under other contracts as an evaluation factor; or (2) Consider losses or profits realized or anticipated under other contracts.\
(c) Not include in a contract price any amount for a specified contingency to the extent that the contract provides for a price adjustment based upon the occurrence of that contingency.\

\f0\b 15.403 Obtaining certified cost or pricing data.\
15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing data (10 U.S.C. chapter 271 and 41 U.S.C. CHAPTER 35).\

\f1\b0 (a) Certified cost or pricing data shall not be obtained for acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(b) 
\f2\i Exceptions to certified cost or pricing data requirements
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall not require certified cost or pricing data to support any action (contracts, subcontracts, or modifications) (but may require data other than certified cost or pricing data as defined in FAR \cf3 2.101 \cf4 to support a determination of a fair and reasonable price or cost realism)\'97\

(c) Standards for exceptions from certified cost or pricing data requirements\'97\
(1) 
\f2\i Adequate price competition
\f1\i0 . (i) A price is based on adequate price competition when\'97\
(A) Two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Government\'92s expressed requirement;\
(B) Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) where price is a substantial factor in source selection; and\
(C) There is no finding that the price of the otherwise successful offeror is unreasonable. Any finding that the price is unreasonable must be supported by a statement of the facts and approved at a level above the contracting officer.\
(ii) For agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, a price is also based on adequate price competition when\'96\
(A) There was a reasonable expectation, based on market research or other assessment, that two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, would submit priced offers in response to the solicitation's expressed requirement, even though only one offer is received from a responsible offeror and if-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Based on the offer received, the contracting officer can reasonably conclude that the offer was submitted with the expectation of competition, e.g., circumstances indicate that\'96\

\f2\i (i) 
\f1\i0 The offeror believed that at least one other offeror was capable of submitting a meaningful offer; and\

\f2\i (ii) 
\f1\i0 The offeror had no reason to believe that other potential offerors did not intend to submit an offer; and 
\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 The determination that the proposed price is based on adequate price competition and is reasonable has\
been approved at a level above the contracting officer; or\
(B) Price analysis clearly demonstrates that the proposed price is reasonable in comparison with current or recent\
prices for the same or similar items, adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions, economic conditions, quantities, or terms and conditions under contracts that resulted from adequate price competition.\
(2) 
\f2\i Prices set by law or regulation
\f1\i0 . Pronouncements in the form of periodic rulings, reviews, or similar actions of a governmental body, or embodied in the laws, are sufficient to set a price.\
(3) 
\f2\i Commercial products and commercial services. 
\f1\i0 (i) Any acquisition that the contracting officer determines meets the commercial product or commercial service definition in \cf3 2.101\cf4 , or any modification, as defined in paragraph (3)(i) of\
the commercial product definition, that does not change a commercial product to other than commercial, is exempt from\
the requirement for certified cost or pricing data. If the contracting officer determines that a product or service claimed to\
be commercial is not, and that no other exception or waiver applies (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , the acquisition is not based on adequate price competition; the acquisition is not based on prices set by law or regulation; and the acquisition exceeds the threshold for the submission of certified cost or pricing data at \cf3 15.403-4\cf4 (a)(1)) the contracting officer shall require submission of certified cost or pricing data.\
(ii) In accordance with section \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3501\cf4 :\
(A) When purchasing services that are not offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the\
commercial marketplace, but are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, they may be considered commercial services (thus meeting the purpose of \cf3 41 U.S.C.chapter 35 \cf4 and 10 U.S.C. chapter 271 for truth in negotiations) only if the contracting officer determines in writing that the offeror has submitted sufficient information to evaluate, through price analysis, the reasonableness of the price of such services.\
(B) In order to make this determination, the contracting officer may request the offeror to submit prices paid for the same or similar commercial services under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers; and\
(C) If the contracting officer determines that the information described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs and overhead rates may be requested.\
(iii) The following requirements apply to minor modifications defined in paragraph (3)(ii) of the definition of a commercial product at \cf3 2.101 \cf4 that do not change the commercial product to other than commercial:\

\f1\b0 (A) For acquisitions funded by any agency other than DoD, NASA, or Coast Guard, such modifications of a commercial product are exempt from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data.\
(B) For acquisitions funded by DoD, NASA, or Coast Guard, such modifications of a commercial product are exempt from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data provided the total price of all such modifications under a particular contract action does not exceed the greater of the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data in \cf3 15.403-4 \cf4 or 5 percent of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award.\
(C) For acquisitions funded by DoD, NASA, or Coast Guard such modifications of a commercial product are not exempt from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data on the basis of the exemption provided for at \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(3) if the total price of all such modifications under a particular contract action exceeds the greater of the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data in \cf3 15.403-4 \cf4 or 5 percent of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award.\
(iv) Any acquisition for other than commercial products or services treated as commercial products or commercial services at \cf3 12.102\cf4 (f)(1), except sole source contracts greater than $20 million, is exempt from the requirements for certified cost or pricing data (\cf3 41 U.S.C.1903\cf4 ).\
(4) 
\f2\i Waivers
\f1\i0 . The head of the contracting activity (HCA) may, without power of delegation, waive the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data in exceptional cases. The authorization for the waiver and the supporting rationale shall be in writing. The HCA may consider waiving the requirement if the price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without submission of certified cost or pricing data. For example, if certified cost or pricing data were furnished on previous production buys and the contracting officer determines such data are sufficient, when combined with updated data, a waiver may be granted. If the HCA has waived the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data, the contractor or higher-tier subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as having been required to provide certified cost or pricing data. Consequently, award of any lower-tier subcontract expected to exceed the certified cost or pricing data threshold requires the submission of certified cost or pricing data unless-\
(i) An exception otherwise applies to the subcontract; or\
(ii) The waiver specifically includes the subcontract and the rationale supporting the waiver for that subcontract.\

\f0\b 15.403-2 Other circumstances where certified cost or pricing data are not required.\

\f1\b0 (a) The exercise of an option at the price established at contract award or initial negotiation does not require submission of certified cost or pricing data.\
(b) Certified cost or pricing data are not required for proposals used solely for overrun funding or interim billing price adjustments.\

\f0\b 15.403-3 Requiring data other than certified cost or pricing data.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) In those acquisitions that do not require certified cost or pricing data, the contracting officer shall\'97\
(i) Obtain whatever data are available from Government or other secondary sources and use that data in determining\
a fair and reasonable price;\
(ii) Require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data, as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 , from the offeror to the\
extent necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3705(a) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3505(a)\cf4 ) if the contracting officer determines that adequate data from sources other than the offeror are not available. This includes requiring data from an offeror to support a cost realism analysis;\
(iii) Consider whether cost data are necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price when there is not adequate price competition;\
(iv) Require that the data submitted by the offeror include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price unless an exception under \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b)(1) or (2) applies; and\
(v) Consider the guidance in section \cf3 3.3\cf4 , chapter 3, volume I, of the Contract Pricing Reference Guide cited at \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (a)(7) to determine the data an offeror shall be required to submit.\
(2) The contractor\'92s format for submitting the data should be used (see \cf3 15.403-5\cf4 (b)(2)).\
(3) The contracting officer shall ensure that data used to support price negotiations are sufficiently current to permit negotiation of a fair and reasonable price. Requests for updated offeror data should be limited to data that affect the adequacy of the proposal for negotiations, such as changes in price lists.\
(4) As specified in section 808 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Pub. L. 105-261), an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit data for a contract or subcontract in accordance\

\fs20 with paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection is ineligible for award unless the HCA determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to that offeror, based on consideration of the following:\
(i) The effort made to obtain the data.\
(ii) The need for the item or service.\
(iii) Increased cost or significant harm to the Government if award is not made.\
(b) Adequate price competition. When adequate price competition exists (see \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(1)), generally no additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price. However, if there are unusual circumstances where it is concluded that additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, obtain the additional data from sources other than the offeror. In addition, the contracting officer should request data to determine the cost realism of competing offers or to evaluate competing approaches.\
(c) 
\f2\i Commercial products and commercial services. 
\f1\i0 (1) At a minimum, the contracting officer must use price analysis\
to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable whenever the contracting officer acquires a commercial product or commercial service (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (b)). The fact that a price is included in a catalog does not, in and of itself, make it fair and reasonable. If the contracting officer cannot determine whether an offered price is fair and reasonable, even after obtaining additional data from sources other than the offeror, then the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit data other than certified cost or pricing data to support further analysis (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 ). This data may include history of sales to non- governmental and governmental entities, cost data, or any other information the contracting officer requires to determine\
the price is fair and reasonable. Unless an exception under \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b)(1) or (2) applies, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted by the offeror include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price.\
(2) 
\f2\i Limitations relating to commercial products or commercial services 
\f1\i0 \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3705(b) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3505(b)\cf4 ). (i) The contracting officer shall limit requests for sales data relating to commercial products or commercial services to data for the same or similar items during a relevant time period.\
(ii) The contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, limit the scope of the request for data relating to commercial products or commercial services to include only data that are in the form regularly maintained by the offeror as part of its commercial operations.\
(iii) The Government shall not disclose outside the Government data obtained relating to commercial products or commercial services that is exempt from disclosure under \cf3 24.202\cf4 (a) or the Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C.552(b)\cf4 ).\
(3) For services that are not offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, but are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, see \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(3)(ii).\

\f0\b 15.403-4 Requiring certified cost or pricing data (10 U.S.C. chapter 271 and 41 U.S.C. chapter 35).\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The contracting officer shall obtain certified cost or pricing data only if the contracting officer concludes that none of the exceptions in \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b) applies. However, if the contracting officer has reason to believe exceptional circumstances exist and has sufficient data available to determine a fair and reasonable price, then the contracting officer should consider requesting a waiver under the exception at \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b)(4). The threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data is $750,000 for prime contracts awarded before July 1, 2018, and $2 million for prime contracts awarded on or after July 1, 2018.When a clause refers to this threshold, and if the threshold is adjusted for inflation pursuant to \cf3 1.109\cf4 (a), then pursuant to \cf3 1.109\cf4 (d) the changed threshold applies throughout the remaining term of the contract, unless there is a subsequent threshold adjustment. Unless an exception applies, certified cost or pricing data are required before accomplishing any of the following actions expected to exceed the current threshold or, in the case of existing contracts, the threshold specified in the contract:\
(i) The award of any negotiated contract (except for undefinitized actions such as letter contracts).\
(ii) The award of a subcontract at any tier, if the contractor and each higher-tier subcontractor were required to furnish certified cost or pricing data (but see waivers at \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(4)).\
(iii) The modification of any sealed bid or negotiated contract (whether or not certified cost or pricing data were initially required) or any subcontract covered by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this subsection. Price adjustment amounts must consider both increases and decreases (e.g., a $500,000 modification resulting from a reduction of $1,500,000 and an increase of $1,000,000 is a $2,500,000 pricing adjustment exceeding the $2,000,000 threshold). This requirement does not apply when unrelated and separately priced changes for which certified cost or pricing data would not otherwise be required are included for administrative convenience in the same modification. Negotiated final pricing actions (such as termination settlements and total final price agreements for fixed-price incentive and redeterminable contracts) are contract modifications requiring certified cost or pricing data if-\

\f1\b0 (A) The total final price agreement for such settlements or agreements exceeds the pertinent threshold set forth at paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection; or\
(B) The partial termination settlement plus the estimate to complete the continued portion of the contract exceeds the pertinent threshold set forth at paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection (see \cf3 49.105\cf4 (c)(15)).\
(2) Unless prohibited because an exception at \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b) applies, the head of the contracting activity, without power of delegation, may authorize the contracting officer to obtain certified cost or pricing data for pricing actions below the pertinent threshold in paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection, provided the action exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. The head\
of the contracting activity shall justify the requirement for certified cost or pricing data. The documentation shall include a written finding that certified cost or pricing data are necessary to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable and the facts supporting that finding.\
(3) Upon the request of a contractor that was required to submit certified cost or pricing data in connection with a prime contract entered into before July 1, 2018, the contracting officer shall modify the contract, without requiring consideration, to reflect a $2 million threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data on subcontracts entered on and after July 1, 2018. See \cf3 15.408\cf4 .\
(b) When certified cost or pricing data are required, the contracting officer shall require the contractor or prospective contractor to submit to the contracting officer (and to have any subcontractor or prospective subcontractor submit to the prime contractor or appropriate subcontractor tier) the following in support of any proposal:\
(1) The certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data required by the contracting officer to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.\
(2) A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, in the format specified in \cf3 15.406-2\cf4 , certifying that to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data were accurate, complete, and current as of the date of agreement on price or, if applicable, an earlier date agreed upon between the parties that is as close as practicable to the date of agreement on price.\
(c) If certified cost or pricing data are requested and submitted by an offeror, but an exception is later found to apply, the data must not be considered certified cost or pricing data as defined in \cf3 2.101 \cf4 and must not be certified in accordance with \cf3 15.406-2\
\cf4 (d) The requirements of this subsection also apply to contracts entered into by an agency on behalf of a foreign government.\

\f0\b 15.403-5 Instructions for submission of certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data.\

\f1\b0 (a) Taking into consideration the policy at \cf3 15.402\cf4 , the contracting officer shall specify in the solicitation (see \cf3 15.408\cf4 (l) and (m))-\
(1) Whether certified cost or pricing data are required;\
(2) That, in lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, the offeror may submit a request for exception from the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data;\
(3) Any requirement for data other than certified cost or pricing data; and\
(4) The requirement for necessary preaward or postaward access to offeror\'92s records.\
(b) (1) 
\f2\i Format for submission of certified cost or pricing data
\f1\i0 . When certification is required, the contracting officer may\
require submission of certified cost or pricing data in the format indicated in \cf3 Table 15-1 \cf4 of \cf3 15.408\cf4 , specify an alternative format, or permit submission in the contractor\'92s format (See \cf3 15.408\cf4 (l)(1)), unless the data are required to be submitted on one of the termination forms specified in \cf3 subpart 49.6\cf4 .\
(2) 
\f2\i Format for submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data
\f1\i0 . When required by the contracting officer, data other than certified cost or pricing data may be submitted in the offeror\'92s own format unless the contracting officer decides that use of a specific format is essential for evaluating and determining that the price is fair and reasonable and the format has been described in the solicitation.\
(3) 
\f2\i Format for submission of data supporting forward pricing rate agreements
\f1\i0 . Data supporting forward pricing rate agreements or final indirect cost proposals shall be submitted in a form acceptable to the contracting officer.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General. 
\f1\i0 The objective of proposal analysis is to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable. (1) The contracting officer is responsible for evaluating the reasonableness of the offered prices. The analytical\
techniques and procedures described in this subsection may be used, singly or in combination with others, to ensure that the 15.4-5\

\fs20 final price is fair and reasonable. The complexity and circumstances of each acquisition should determine the level of detail of the analysis required.\
(2) Price analysis shall be used when certified cost or pricing data are not required (see paragraph (b) of this subsection and \cf3 15.404-3\cf4 ).\
(3) Cost analysis shall be used to evaluate the reasonableness of individual cost elements when certified cost or pricing data are required. Price analysis should be used to verify that the overall price offered is fair and reasonable.\
(4) Cost analysis may also be used to evaluate data other than certified cost or pricing data to determine cost reasonableness or cost realism when a fair and reasonable price cannot be determined through price analysis alone.\
(5) The contracting officer may request the advice and assistance of other experts to ensure that an appropriate analysis is performed.\
(6) Recommendations or conclusions regarding the Government\'92s review or analysis of an offeror\'92s or contractor\'92s proposal shall not be disclosed to the offeror or contractor without the concurrence of the contracting officer. Any discrepancy or mistake of fact (such as duplications, omissions, and errors in computation) contained in the certified cost or pricing data or data other than certified cost or pricing data submitted in support of a proposal shall be brought to the contracting officer\'92s attention for appropriate action.\
(7) The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) and the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) jointly prepared a five- volume set of Contract Pricing Reference Guides to guide pricing and negotiation personnel. The five guides are: I Price Analysis, II Quantitative Techniques for Contract Pricing, III Cost Analysis, IV Advanced Issues in Contract Pricing, and V Federal Contract Negotiation Techniques. These references provide detailed discussion and examples applying pricing policies to pricing problems. They are to be used for instruction and professional guidance. However, they are not directive and should be considered informational only. They are available via the internet at \cf3 http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/ contract_pricing_reference_guides.html\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Price analysis. 
\f1\i0 (1) Price analysis is the process of examining and evaluating a proposed price without evaluating\
its separate cost elements and proposed profit. Unless an exception from the requirement to obtain certified cost or pricing data applies under \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b)(1) or (b)(2), at a minimum, the contracting officer shall obtain appropriate data, without certification, on the prices at which the same or similar items have previously been sold and determine if the data is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price. Price analysis may include evaluating data other than certified cost or pricing data obtained from the offeror or contractor when there is no other means for determining a fair and reasonable price. Contracting officers shall obtain data other than certified cost or pricing data from the offeror or contractor for all acquisitions (including commercial acquisitions), if that is the contracting officer\'92s only means to determine the price to be fair and reasonable.\
(2) The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price. Examples of such techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:\
(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes a fair and reasonable price (see \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(1)).\
(ii) Comparison of the proposed prices to historical prices paid, whether by the Government or other than the Government, for the same or similar items. This method may be used for commercial products or commercial services including those \'93of a type\'94 or when requiring minor modifications for commercial products.\
(A) The prior price must be a valid basis for comparison. If there has been a significant time lapse between the last acquisition and the present one, if the terms and conditions of the acquisition are significantly different, or if the reasonableness of the prior price is uncertain, then the prior price may not be a valid basis for comparison.\
(B) The prior price must be adjusted to account for materially differing terms and conditions, quantities and market and economic factors. For similar items, the contracting officer must also adjust the prior price to account for material differences between the similar item and the item being procured.\
(C) Expert technical advice should be obtained when analyzing similar items, or commercial products or commercial services that are \'93of a type\'94, or requiring minor modifications for commercial products, to ascertain the magnitude of changes required and to assist in pricing the required changes\
(iii) Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks (such as dollars per pound or per horsepower, or other units) to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry.\
(iv) Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements.\
(v) Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates.\
(vi) Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items.\

\f1\b0 (vii) Analysis of data other than certified cost or pricing data (as defined at \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) provided by the offeror. (3) The first two techniques at \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (b)(2) are the preferred techniques. However, if the contracting officer\
determines that information on competitive proposed prices or previous contract prices is not available or is insufficient to determine that the price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer may use any of the remaining techniques as appropriate to the circumstances applicable to the acquisition.\
(4) Value analysis can give insight into the relative worth of a product and the Government may use it in conjunction with the price analysis techniques listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\
(c) Cost analysis. (1) Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of any separate cost elements and profit or fee in an offeror\'92s or contractor\'92s proposal, as needed to determine a fair and reasonable price or to determine cost realism, and the application of judgment to determine how well the proposed costs represent what the cost of the contract should be, assuming reasonable economy and efficiency.\
(2) The Government may use various cost analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price, given the circumstances of the acquisition. Such techniques and procedures include the following:\
(i) Verification of cost data or pricing data and evaluation of cost elements, including-\
(A) The necessity for, and reasonableness of, proposed costs, including allowances for contingencies;\
(B) Projection of the offeror\'92s cost trends, on the basis of current and historical cost or pricing data;\
(C) Reasonableness of estimates generated by appropriately calibrated and validated parametric models or cost-\
estimating relationships; and\
(D) The application of audited or negotiated indirect cost rates, labor rates, and cost of money or other factors.\
(ii) Evaluating the effect of the offeror\'92s current practices on future costs. In conducting this evaluation, the contracting officer shall ensure that the effects of inefficient or uneconomical past practices are not projected into the future. In pricing production of recently developed complex equipment, the contracting officer should perform a trend analysis of basic labor and materials, even in periods of relative price stability.\
(iii) Comparison of costs proposed by the offeror for individual cost elements with-\
(A) Actual costs previously incurred by the same offeror;\
(B) Previous cost estimates from the offeror or from other offerors for the same or similar items; (C) Other cost estimates received in response to the Government\'92s request;\
(D) Independent Government cost estimates by technical personnel; and\
(E) Forecasts of planned expenditures.\
(iv) Verification that the offeror's cost submissions are in accordance with the contract cost principles and procedures in \cf3 part 31 \cf4 and, when applicable, the requirements and procedures in 48 CFR chapter 99, Cost Accounting Standards.\
(v) Review to determine whether any cost data or pricing data, necessary to make the offeror\'92s proposal suitable for negotiation, have not been either submitted or identified in writing by the offeror. If there are such data, the contracting officer shall attempt to obtain and use them in the negotiations or make satisfactory allowance for the incomplete data.\
(vi) Analysis of the results of any make-or-buy program reviews, in evaluating subcontract costs (see \cf3 15.407-2\cf4 ). (d) Cost realism analysis. (1) Cost realism analysis is the process of independently reviewing and evaluating specific\
elements of each offeror\'92s proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror\'92s technical proposal.\
(2) Cost realism analyses shall be performed on cost-reimbursement contracts to determine the probable cost of performance for each offeror.\
(i) The probable cost may differ from the proposed cost and should reflect the Government\'92s best estimate of the cost of any contract that is most likely to result from the offeror\'92s proposal. The probable cost shall be used for purposes of evaluation to determine the best value.\
(ii) The probable cost is determined by adjusting each offeror\'92s proposed cost, and fee when appropriate, to reflect any additions or reductions in cost elements to realistic levels based on the results of the cost realism analysis.\
(3) Cost realism analyses may also be used on competitive fixed-price incentive contracts or, in exceptional cases, on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts when new requirements may not be fully understood by competing offerors, there are quality concerns, or past experience indicates that contractors\'92 proposed costs have resulted in quality or service shortfalls. Results of the analysis may be used in performance risk assessments and responsibility determinations. However, proposals shall be evaluated using the criteria in the solicitation, and the offered prices shall not be adjusted as a result of the analysis.\

\fs20 (e) Technical analysis. (1) The contracting officer should request that personnel having specialized knowledge, skills, experience, or capability in engineering, science, or management perform a technical analysis of the proposed types and quantities of materials, labor, processes, special tooling, equipment or real property, the reasonableness of scrap and spoilage, and other associated factors set forth in the proposal(s) in order to determine the need for and reasonableness of the proposed resources, assuming reasonable economy and efficiency.\
(2) At a minimum, the technical analysis should examine the types and quantities of material proposed and the need for the types and quantities of labor hours and the labor mix. Any other data that may be pertinent to an assessment of the offeror\'92s ability to accomplish the technical requirements or to the cost or price analysis of the service or product being proposed should also be included in the analysis.\
(3) The contracting officer should request technical assistance in evaluating pricing related to items that are "similar to" items being purchased, or commercial products or commercial services that are \'93of a type\'94, or requiring minor modifications for commercial products, to ascertain the magnitude of changes required and to assist in pricing the required changes.\
(f) Unit prices. (1) Except when pricing an item on the basis of adequate price competition or catalog or market price, unit prices shall reflect the intrinsic value of an item or service and shall be in proportion to an item\'92s base cost (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 manufacturing or acquisition costs). Any method of distributing costs to line items that distorts the unit prices shall not be used. For example, distributing costs equally among line items is not acceptable except when there is little or no variation in base cost.\
(2) Except for the acquisition of commercial products, contracting officers shall require that offerors identify in their proposals those items of supply that they will not manufacture or to which they will not contribute significant value, unless adequate price competition is expected (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1)(A) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3503(a)(1)(A)\cf4 ). Such information shall be used to determine whether the intrinsic value of an item has been distorted through application of overhead and whether such items should be considered for breakout. The contracting officer should require such information in all other negotiated contracts when appropriate.\
(g) Unbalanced pricing. (1) Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The greatest risks associated with unbalanced pricing occur when-\
(i) Startup work, mobilization, first articles, or first article testing are separate line items;\
(ii) Base quantities and option quantities are separate line items; or\
(iii) The evaluated price is the aggregate of estimated quantities to be ordered under separate line items of an\
indefinite-delivery contract.\
(2) All offers with separately priced line items or subline items shall be analyzed to determine if the prices are\
unbalanced. If cost or price analysis techniques indicate that an offer is unbalanced, the contracting officer shall-\
(i) Consider the risks to the Government associated with the unbalanced pricing in determining the competitive\
range and in making the source selection decision; and\
(ii) Consider whether award of the contract will result in paying unreasonably high prices for contract performance.\
(3) An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.\
(h) Review and justification of pass-through contracts. (1) The requirements of this paragraph (h) are applicable to all agencies. The requirements apply by law to the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the United States Agency for International Development, per section 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013. The requirements apply as a matter of policy to other Federal agencies.\
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, when an offeror for a contract or a task or delivery order informs the contracting officer pursuant to \cf3 52.215-22 \cf4 that it intends to award subcontracts for more than 70 percent of the total cost of work to be performed under the contract, task or delivery order, the contracting officer shall\'96\
(i) Consider the availability of alternative contract vehicles and the feasibility of contracting directly with a subcontractor or subcontractors that will perform the bulk of the work. If such alternative approaches are selected, any resulting solicitations shall be issued in accordance with the competition requirements under FAR \cf3 part 6\cf4 ;\
(ii) Make a written determination that the contracting approach selected is in the best interest of the Government; and\
(iii) Document the basis for such determination.\
(3) Contract actions awarded pursuant to \cf3 subparts 19.5\cf4 , \cf3 19.8\cf4 , \cf3 19.13\cf4 , \cf3 19.14\cf4 , or \cf3 19.15 \cf4 are exempt from the requirements\
of this paragraph (h) (see section 1615 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Pub. L. 113-66)). 15.4-8\

 15.404-2 Data to support proposal analysis.\

\f1\b0 (a) Field pricing assistance. (1) The contracting officer should request field pricing assistance when the information available at the buying activity is inadequate to determine a fair and reasonable price. The contracting officer shall tailor requests to reflect the minimum essential supplementary information needed to conduct a technical or cost or pricing analysis.\
(2) The contracting officer shall tailor the type of information and level of detail requested in accordance with the specialized resources available at the buying activity and the magnitude and complexity of the required analysis. Field pricing assistance is generally available to provide-\
(i) Technical, audit, and special reports associated with the cost elements of a proposal, including subcontracts; (ii) Information on related pricing practices and history;\
(iii) Information to help contracting officers determine commerciality and a fair and reasonable price, including-\
(A) Verifying sales history to source documents;\
(B) Identifying special terms and conditions;\
(C) Identifying customarily granted or offered discounts for the item;\
(D) Verifying the item to an existing catalog or price list;\
(E) Verifying historical data for a product or service previously not determined commercial that the offeror is now\
trying to qualify as a commercial product or commercial service; and\
(F) Identifying general market conditions affecting determinations of commerciality and a fair and reasonable\
price.\
(iv) Information relative to the business, technical, production, or other capabilities and practices of an offeror.\
(3) When field pricing assistance is requested, contracting officers are encouraged to team with appropriate field experts throughout the acquisition process, including negotiations. Early communication with these experts will assist in determining the extent of assistance required, the specific areas for which assistance is needed, a realistic review schedule, and the information necessary to perform the review.\
(4) When requesting field pricing assistance on a contractor\'92s request for equitable adjustment, the contracting officer shall provide the information listed in \cf3 43.204\cf4 (b)(5).\
(5) Field pricing information and other reports may include proprietary or source selection information (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ). This information must be appropriately identified and protected accordingly.\
(b) Reporting field pricing information. (1) Depending upon the extent and complexity of the field pricing review, results, including supporting rationale, may be reported directly to the contracting officer orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.\
(i) Whenever circumstances permit, the contracting officer and field pricing experts are encouraged to use telephonic and/or electronic means to request and transmit pricing information.\
(ii) When it is necessary to have written technical and audit reports, the contracting officer shall request that the audit agency concurrently forward the audit report to the requesting contracting officer and the administrative contracting officer (ACO). The completed field pricing assistance results may reference audit information, but need not reconcile the audit recommendations and technical recommendations. A copy of the information submitted to the contracting officer by field pricing personnel shall be provided to the audit agency.\
(2) Audit and field pricing information, whether written or reported telephonically or electronically, shall be made a part of the official contract file (see \cf3 4.803\cf4 (a)(19)).\
(c) Audit assistance for prime contracts or subcontracts. (1) The contracting officer should contact the cognizant audit office directly, particularly when an audit is the only field pricing support required. The audit office shall send the audit report, or otherwise transmit the audit recommendations, directly to the contracting officer.\
(i) The auditor shall not reveal the audit conclusions or recommendations to the offeror/contractor without obtaining the concurrence of the contracting officer. However, the auditor may discuss statements of facts with the contractor.\
(ii) The contracting officer should be notified immediately of any information disclosed to the auditor after\
submission of a report that may significantly affect the audit findings and, if necessary, a supplemental audit report shall be issued.\
(2) The contracting officer shall not request a separate preaward audit of indirect costs unless the information already available from an existing audit, completed within the preceding 12 months, is considered inadequate for determining the reasonableness of the proposed indirect costs (\cf3 41 U.S.C.4706 \cf4 and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3841\cf4 ).\
(3) The auditor is responsible for the scope and depth of the audit. Copies of updated information that will significantly affect the audit should be provided to the auditor by the contracting officer.\

\fs20 (4) General access to the offeror\'92s books and financial records is limited to the auditor. This limitation does not preclude the contracting officer or the ACO, or their representatives, from requesting that the offeror provide or make available any data or records necessary to analyze the offeror\'92s proposal.\
(d) 
\f2\i Deficient proposals
\f1\i0 . The ACO or the auditor, as appropriate, shall notify the contracting officer immediately if the\
data provided for review is so deficient as to preclude review or audit, or if the contractor or offeror has denied access to\
any records considered essential to conduct a satisfactory review or audit. Oral notifications shall be confirmed promptly\
in writing, including a description of deficient or denied data or records. The contracting officer immediately shall take appropriate action to obtain the required data. Should the offeror/contractor again refuse to provide adequate data, or provide access to necessary data, the contracting officer shall withhold the award or price adjustment and refer the contract action to a higher authority, providing details of the attempts made to resolve the matter and a statement of the practicability of obtaining the supplies or services from another source.\

\f0\b 15.404-3 Subcontract pricing considerations.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer is responsible for the determination of a fair and reasonable price for the prime contract, including subcontracting costs. The contracting officer should consider whether a contractor or subcontractor has an approved purchasing system, has performed cost or price analysis of proposed subcontractor prices, or has negotiated the subcontract prices before negotiation of the prime contract, in determining the reasonableness of the prime contract price. This does\
not relieve the contracting officer from the responsibility to analyze the contractor\'92s submission, including subcontractor\'92s certified cost or pricing data.\
(b) The prime contractor or subcontractor shall-\
(1) Conduct appropriate cost or price analyses to establish the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices; (2) Include the results of these analyses in the price proposal; and\
(3) When required by paragraph (c) of this subsection, submit subcontractor certified cost or pricing data to the\
Government as part of its own certified cost or pricing data.\
(c) Any contractor or subcontractor that is required to submit certified cost or pricing data also shall obtain and analyze\
certified cost or pricing data before awarding any subcontract, purchase order, or modification expected to exceed the certified cost or pricing data threshold, unless an exception in \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b) applies to that action.\
(1) The contractor shall submit, or cause to be submitted by the subcontractor(s), certified cost or pricing data to the Government for subcontracts that are the lower of either-\
(i) $15 million or more; or\
(ii) Both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor\'92s proposed price, unless the contracting officer believes such submission is unnecessary.\
(2) The contracting officer should require the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the Government (or cause submission of) subcontractor certified cost or pricing data below the thresholds in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection and data other than certified cost or pricing data that the contracting officer considers necessary for adequately pricing the prime contract.\
(3) Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data shall be submitted in the format provided in \cf3 Table 15-1 \cf4 of \cf3 15.408 \cf4 or the alternate format specified in the solicitation.\
(4) Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data shall be current, accurate, and complete as of the date of price agreement, or, if applicable, an earlier date agreed upon by the parties and specified on the contractor\'92s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The contractor shall update subcontractor\'92s data, as appropriate, during source selection and negotiations.\
(5) If there is more than one prospective subcontractor for any given work, the contractor need only submit to the Government certified cost or pricing data for the prospective subcontractor most likely to receive the award.\

\f0\b 15.404-4 Profit.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . This subsection prescribes policies for establishing the profit or fee portion of the Government prenegotiation objective in price negotiations based on cost analysis.\
(1) Profit or fee prenegotiation objectives do not necessarily represent net income to contractors. Rather, they represent that element of the potential total remuneration that contractors may receive for contract performance over and above allowable costs. This potential remuneration element and the Government\'92s estimate of allowable costs to be incurred in contract performance together equal the Government\'92s total prenegotiation objective. Just as actual costs may vary from\

\fs16 ONTRACT 
\fs20 P
\fs16 RICING 
\f0\b\fs20 15.404-4\
 
\f1\b0 estimated costs, the contractor\'92s actual realized profit or fee may vary from negotiated profit or fee, because of such factors as efficiency of performance, incurrence of costs the Government does not recognize as allowable, and the contract type.\
(2) It is in the Government\'92s interest to offer contractors opportunities for financial rewards sufficient to stimulate efficient contract performance, attract the best capabilities of qualified large and small business concerns to Government contracts, and maintain a viable industrial base.\
(3) Both the Government and contractors should be concerned with profit as a motivator of efficient and effective contract performance. Negotiations aimed merely at reducing prices by reducing profit, without proper recognition of the function of profit, are not in the Government\'92s interest. Negotiation of extremely low profits, use of historical averages, or automatic application of predetermined percentages to total estimated costs do not provide proper motivation for optimum contract performance.\
(b) Policy. (1) Structured approaches (see paragraph (d) of this subsection) for determining profit or fee prenegotiation objectives provide a discipline for ensuring that all relevant factors are considered. Subject to the authorities in \cf3 1.301\cf4 (c), agencies making noncompetitive contract awards over $100,000 totaling $50 million or more ayear-\
(i) Shall use a structured approach for determining the profit or fee objective in those acquisitions that require cost analysis; and\
(ii) May prescribe specific exemptions for situations in which mandatory use of a structured approach would be clearly inappropriate.\
(2) Agencies may use another agency\'92s structured approach.\
(c) Contracting officer responsibilities. (1) When the price negotiation is not based on cost analysis, contracting officers\
are not required to analyze profit.\
(2) When the price negotiation is based on cost analysis, contracting officers in agencies that have a structured\
approach shall use it to analyze profit. When not using a structured approach, contracting officers shall comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this subsection in developing profit or fee prenegotiation objectives.\
(3) Contracting officers shall use the Government prenegotiation cost objective amounts as the basis for calculating the profit or fee prenegotiation objective. Before applying profit or fee factors, the contracting officer shall exclude from the pre-negotiation cost objective amounts the purchase cost of contractor-acquired property that is categorized as equipment, as defined in FAR \cf3 45.101\cf4 , and where such equipment is to be charged directly to the contract. Before applying profit or fee factors, the contracting officer shall exclude any facilities capital cost of money included in the cost objective amounts. If the prospective contractor fails to identify or propose facilities capital cost of money in a proposal for a contract that will be subject to the cost principles for contracts with commercial organizations (see \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 ), facilities capital cost of money will not be an allowable cost in any resulting contract (see \cf3 15.408\cf4 (i)).\
(4) (i) The contracting officer shall not negotiate a price or fee that exceeds the following statutory limitations, imposed by \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3322(b) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3905\cf4 :\
(A) For experimental, developmental, or research work performed under a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, the fee shall not exceed 15 percent of the contract\'92s estimated cost, excluding fee.\
(B) For architect-engineer services for public works or utilities, the contract price or the estimated cost and fee for production and delivery of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications shall not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of construction of the public work or utility, excluding fees.\
(C) For other cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, the fee shall not exceed 10 percent of the contract\'92s estimated cost, excluding fee.\
(ii) The contracting officer\'92s signature on the price negotiation memorandum or other documentation supporting determination of fair and reasonable price documents the contracting officer\'92s determination that the statutory price or fee limitations have not been exceeded.\
(5) The contracting officer shall not require any prospective contractor to submit breakouts or supporting rationale for its profit or fee objective but may consider it, if it is submitted voluntarily.\
(6) If a change or modification calls for essentially the same type and mix of work as the basic contract and is of relatively small dollar value compared to the total contract value, the contracting officer may use the basic contract\'92s profit or fee rate as the prenegotiation objective for that change or modification.\
(d) Profit-analysis factors- (1) 
\f2\i Common factors
\f1\i0 . Unless it is clearly inappropriate or not applicable, each factor outlined in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vi) of this subsection shall be considered by agencies in developing their structured approaches and by contracting officers in analyzing profit, whether or not using a structured approach.\
(i) 
\f2\i Contractor effort
\f1\i0 . This factor measures the complexity of the work and the resources required of the prospective contractor for contract performance. Greater profit opportunity should be provided under contracts requiring a high degree\

\fs20 of professional and managerial skill and to prospective contractors whose skills, facilities, and technical assets can be expected to lead to efficient and economical contract performance. The subfactors in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this subsection shall be considered in determining contractor effort, but they may be modified in specific situations to accommodate differences in the categories used by prospective contractors for listing costs-\
(A) 
\f2\i Material acquisition
\f1\i0 . This subfactor measures the managerial and technical effort needed to obtain the required purchased parts and material, subcontracted items, and special tooling. Considerations include the complexity of the items required, the number of purchase orders and subcontracts to be awarded and administered, whether established sources are available or new or second sources must be developed, and whether material will be obtained through routine purchase orders or through complex subcontracts requiring detailed specifications. Profit consideration should correspond to the managerial and technical effort involved.\
(B) 
\f2\i Conversion direct labor
\f1\i0 . This subfactor measures the contribution of direct engineering, manufacturing, and other labor to converting the raw materials, data, and subcontracted items into the contract items. Considerations include the diversity of engineering, scientific, and manufacturing labor skills required and the amount and quality of supervision and coordination needed to perform the contract task.\
(C) 
\f2\i Conversion-related indirect costs
\f1\i0 . This subfactor measures how much the indirect costs contribute to contract performance. The labor elements in the allocable indirect costs should be given the profit consideration they would receive if treated as direct labor. The other elements of indirect costs should be evaluated to determine whether they merit only limited profit consideration because of their routine nature, or are elements that contribute significantly to the proposed contract.\
(D) 
\f2\i General management
\f1\i0 . This subfactor measures the prospective contractor\'92s other indirect costs and\
general and administrative (G&A) expense, their composition, and how much they contribute to contract performance. Considerations include how labor in the overhead pools would be treated if it were direct labor, whether elements within the pools are routine expenses or instead are elements that contribute significantly to the proposed contract, and whether the elements require routine as opposed to unusual managerial effort and attention.\
(ii) Contract cost risk. (A) This factor measures the degree of cost responsibility and associated risk that the prospective contractor will assume as a result of the contract type contemplated and considering the reliability of the cost estimate in relation to the complexity and duration of the contract task. Determination of contract type should be closely related to the risks involved in timely, cost-effective, and efficient performance. This factor should compensate contractors proportionately for assuming greater cost risks.\
(B) The contractor assumes the greatest cost risk in a closely priced firm-fixed-price contract under which it agrees to perform a complex undertaking on time and at a predetermined price. Some firm-fixed-price contracts may entail substantially less cost risk than others because, for example, the contract task is less complex or many of the contractor\'92s costs are known at the time of price agreement, in which case the risk factor should be reduced accordingly. The contractor assumes the least cost risk in a cost-plus-fixed-fee level-of-effort contract, under which it is reimbursed those costs determined to be allocable and allowable, plus the fixed fee.\
(C) In evaluating assumption of cost risk, contracting officers shall, except in unusual circumstances, treat time- and-materials, labor-hour, and firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contracts as cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.\
(iii) 
\f2\i Federal socioeconomic programs
\f1\i0 . This factor measures the degree of support given by the prospective contractor to Federal socioeconomic programs, such as those involving small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, sheltered workshops for workers with disabilities, and energy conservation. Greater profit opportunity should be provided contractors that have displayed unusual initiative in these programs.\
(iv) 
\f2\i Capital investments
\f1\i0 . This factor takes into account the contribution of contractor investments to efficient and economical contract performance.\
(v) 
\f2\i Cost-control and other past accomplishments
\f1\i0 . This factor allows additional profit opportunities to a prospective contractor that has previously demonstrated its ability to perform similar tasks effectively and economically. In addition, consideration should be given to measures taken by the prospective contractor that result in productivity improvements, and other cost-reduction accomplishments that will benefit the Government in follow-on contracts.\
(vi) 
\f2\i Independent development
\f1\i0 . Under this factor, the contractor may be provided additional profit opportunities in recognition of independent development efforts relevant to the contract end item without Government assistance. The contracting officer should consider whether the development cost was recovered directly or indirectly from Government sources.\

\f2\i Additional factors
\f1\i0 . In order to foster achievement of program objectives, each agency may include additional factors\
in its structured approach or take them into account in the profit analysis of individual contract actions.\

\f0\b 15.405 Price negotiation.\

\f1\b0 (a) The purpose of performing cost or price analysis is to develop a negotiation position that permits the contracting officer and the offeror an opportunity to reach agreement on a fair and reasonable price. A fair and reasonable price does not require that agreement be reached on every element of cost, nor is it mandatory that the agreed price be within the contracting officer\'92s initial negotiation position. Taking into consideration the advisory recommendations, reports of contributing specialists, and the current status of the contractor\'92s purchasing system, the contracting officer is responsible for exercising the requisite judgment needed to reach a negotiated settlement with the offeror and is solely responsible for the final price agreement. However, when significant audit or other specialist recommendations are not adopted, the contracting officer should provide rationale that supports the negotiation result in the price negotiation documentation.\
(b) The contracting officer\'92s primary concern is the overall price the Government will actually pay. The contracting officer\'92s objective is to negotiate a contract of a type and with a price providing the contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. The negotiation of a contract type and a price are related and should be considered together with the issues of risk and uncertainty to the contractor and the Government. Therefore, the contracting officer should not become preoccupied with any single element and should balance the contract type, cost, and profit or fee negotiated to achieve a total result-a price that is fair and reasonable to both the Government and the contractor.\
(c) The Government\'92s cost objective and proposed pricing arrangement directly affect the profit or fee objective. Because profit or fee is only one of several interrelated variables, the contracting officer shall not agree on profit or fee without concurrent agreement on cost and type of contract.\
(d) If, however, the contractor insists on a price or demands a profit or fee that the contracting officer considers unreasonable, and the contracting officer has taken all authorized actions (including determining the feasibility of developing an alternative source) without success, the contracting officer shall refer the contract action to a level above the contracting officer. Disposition of the action should be documented.\

\f0\b 15.406 Documentation.\
15.406-1 Prenegotiation objectives.\

\f1\b0 (a) The prenegotiation objectives establish the Government\'92s initial negotiation position. They assist in the contracting officer\'92s determination of fair and reasonable price. They should be based on the results of the contracting officer\'92s analysis of the offeror\'92s proposal, taking into consideration all pertinent information including field pricing assistance, audit reports and technical analysis, fact-finding results, independent Government cost estimates and price histories.\
(b) The contracting officer shall establish prenegotiation objectives before the negotiation of any pricing action. The scope and depth of the analysis supporting the objectives should be directly related to the dollar value, importance, and complexity of the pricing action. When cost analysis is required, the contracting officer shall document the pertinent issues to be negotiated, the cost objectives, and a profit or fee objective.\

\f0\b 15.406-2 Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.\

\f1\b0 (a) When certified cost or pricing data are required, the contracting officer shall require the contractor to execute a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, using the format in this paragraph, and must include the executed certificate in the contract file.\

(End of certificate)\
(b) The certificate does not constitute a representation as to the accuracy of the contractor\'92s judgment on the estimate of future costs or projections. It applies to the data upon which the judgment or estimate was based. This distinction between fact and judgment should be clearly understood. If the contractor had information reasonably available at the time of agreement showing that the negotiated price was not based on accurate, complete, and current data, the contractor\'92s responsibility is not limited by any lack of personal knowledge of the information on the part of its negotiators.\
(c) The contracting officer and contractor are encouraged to reach a prior agreement on criteria for establishing closing or cutoff dates when appropriate in order to minimize delays associated with proposal updates. Closing or cutoff dates should be included as part of the data submitted with the proposal and, before agreement on price, data should be updated by the contractor to the latest closing or cutoff dates for which the data are available. Use of cutoff dates coinciding with reports is acceptable, as certain data may not be reasonably available before normal periodic closing dates (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 actual indirect costs). Data within the contractor\'92s or a subcontractor\'92s organization on matters significant to contractor management and to the Government will be treated as reasonably available. What is significant depends upon the circumstances of each acquisition.\
(d) Possession of a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data is not a substitute for examining and analyzing the contractor\'92s proposal.\
(e) If certified cost or pricing data are requested by the Government and submitted by an offeror, but an exception is later found to apply, the data shall not be considered certified cost or pricing data and shall not be certified in accordance with this subsection.\

\f0\b 15.406-3 Documenting the negotiation.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall document in the contract file the principal elements of the negotiated agreement. The documentation (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 price negotiation memorandum (PNM)) shall include the following:\
(1) The purpose of the negotiation.\
(2) A description of the acquisition, including appropriate identifying numbers (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 RFP No.).\
(3) The name, position, and organization of each person representing the contractor and the Government in the\
negotiation.\
(4) The current status of any contractor systems (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 purchasing, estimating, accounting, and compensation) to the\
extent they affected and were considered in the negotiation.\
(5) If certified cost or pricing data were not required in the case of any price negotiation exceeding the certified cost or\
pricing data threshold, the exception used and the basis for it.\
(6) If certified cost or pricing data were required, the extent to which the contracting officer-\
(i) Relied on the certified cost or pricing data submitted and used them in negotiating the price;\
(ii) Recognized as inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent any certified cost or pricing data submitted; the action taken by the contracting officer and the contractor as a result; and the effect of the defective data on the price negotiated; or\
(iii) Determined that an exception applied after the data were submitted and, therefore, considered not to be certified cost or pricing data.\
(7) A summary of the contractor\'92s proposal, any field pricing assistance recommendations, including the reasons\
for any pertinent variances from them, the Government\'92s negotiation objective, and the negotiated position. Where the determination of a fair and reasonable price is based on cost analysis, the summary shall address each major cost element. When determination of a fair and reasonable price is based on price analysis, the summary shall include the source and type of data used to support the determination.\

\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 officials who would not normally exercise authority during the award and review process for the instant contract action).\
(10) The basis for the profit or fee prenegotiation objective and the profit or fee negotiated.\
(11) Documentation of fair and reasonable pricing.\
(b) Whenever field pricing assistance has been obtained, the contracting officer shall forward a copy of the negotiation\
documentation to the office(s) providing assistance. When appropriate, information on how advisory field support can be made more effective should be provided separately.\

\f0\b 15.407 Special cost or pricing areas.\
15.407-1 Defective certified cost or pricing data.\

\f1\b0 (a) If, before agreement on price, the contracting officer learns that any certified cost or pricing data submitted are inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent, the contracting officer shall immediately bring the matter to the attention of the prospective contractor, whether the defective data increase or decrease the contract price. The contracting officer shall consider any new data submitted to correct the deficiency, or consider the inaccuracy, incompleteness, or noncurrency of the data when negotiating the contract price. The price negotiation memorandum shall reflect the adjustments made to the data or the corrected data used to negotiate the contract price.\
(b) (1) If, after award, certified cost or pricing data are found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent as of the date of final agreement on price or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties given on the contractor's or subcontractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, the Government is entitled to a price adjustment, including profit or fee, of any significant amount by which the price was increased because of the defective data. This entitlement is ensured by including in the contract one of the clauses prescribed in \cf3 15.408\cf4 (b) and (c) and is set forth in the clauses at \cf3 52.215-10\cf4 , Price Reduction for Defective Certified Cost or Pricing Data, and \cf3 52.215-11\cf4 , Price Reduction for Defective Certified Cost or Pricing Data- Modifications. The clauses give the Government the right to a price adjustment for defects in certified cost or pricing data submitted by the contractor, a prospective subcontractor, or an actual subcontractor.\
(2) In arriving at a price adjustment, the contracting officer shall consider the time by which the certified cost or pricing data became reasonably available to the contractor, and the extent to which the Government relied upon the defective data.\
(3) The clauses referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection recognize that the Government\'92s right to a price adjustment is not affected by any of the following circumstances:\
(i) The contractor or subcontractor was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position;\
(ii) The contracting officer should have known that the certified cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;\
(iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or\
(iv) Certified cost or pricing data were required; however, the contractor or subcontractor did not submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data relating to the contract.\
(4) Subject to paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall allow an offset for any understated certified cost or pricing data submitted in support of price negotiations, up to the amount of the Government\'92s claim for overstated pricing data arising out of the same pricing action (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 the initial pricing of the same contract or the pricing of the same change order).\
(5) An offset shall be allowed only in an amount supported by the facts and if the contractor-\
(i) Certifies to the contracting officer that, to the best of the contractor\'92s knowledge and belief, the contractor is\
entitled to the offset in the amount requested; and\
(ii) Proves that the certified cost or pricing data were available before the "as of" date specified on the Certificate\
of Current Cost or Pricing Data but were not submitted. Such offsets need not be in the same cost groupings (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 material, direct labor, or indirect costs).\
(6) An offset shall not be allowed if-\
(i) The understated data were known by the contractor to be understated before the "as of" date specified on the\
Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data; or\

\fs20 (ii) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even if the available data had been submitted before the "as of" date specified on the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.\
(7) (i) In addition to the price adjustment, the Government is entitled to recovery of any overpayment plus interest on the overpayments. The Government is also entitled to penalty amounts on certain of these overpayments. Overpayment occurs only when payment is made for supplies or services accepted by the Government. Overpayments do not result from amounts paid for contract financing, as defined in \cf3 32.001\cf4 .\
(ii) In calculating the interest amount due, the contracting officer shall-\
(A) Determine the defective pricing amounts that have been overpaid to the contractor;\
(B) Consider the date of each overpayment (the date of overpayment for this interest calculation shall be the\
date payment was made for the related completed and accepted contract items; or for subcontract defective pricing, the date payment was made to the prime contractor, based on prime contract progress billings or deliveries, which included payments for a completed and accepted subcontract item); and\
(C) Apply the underpayment interest rate(s) in effect for each quarter from the time of overpayment to the time of repayment, utilizing rate(s) prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under \cf3 26 U.S.C.6621(a)(2)\cf4 .\
(iii) In arriving at the amount due for penalties on contracts where the submission of defective certified cost or pricing data was a knowing submission, the contracting officer shall obtain an amount equal to the amount of overpayment made. Before taking any contractual actions concerning penalties, the contracting officer shall obtain the advice of counsel.\
(iv) In the demand letter, the contracting officer shall separately include- (A) The repayment amount;\
(B) The penalty amount (if any);\
(C) The interest amount through a specified date; and\
(D) A statement that interest will continue to accrue until repayment is made.\
(c) If, after award, the contracting officer learns or suspects that the data furnished were not accurate, complete, and\
current, or were not adequately verified by the contractor as of the time of negotiation, the contracting officer shall request an audit to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and currency of the data. The Government may evaluate the profit-cost relationships only if the audit reveals that the data certified by the contractor were defective. The contracting officer shall not reprice the contract solely because the profit was greater than forecast or because a contingency specified in the submission failed to materialize.\
(d) For each advisory audit received based on a postaward review that indicates defective pricing, the contracting officer shall make a determination as to whether or not the data submitted were defective and relied upon. Before making such a determination, the contracting officer should give the contractor an opportunity to support the accuracy, completeness, and currency of the data in question. The contracting officer shall prepare a memorandum documenting both the determination and any corrective action taken as a result. The contracting officer shall send one copy of this memorandum to the auditor and, if the contract has been assigned for administration, one copy to the administrative contracting officer (ACO). A copy of the memorandum or other notice of the contracting officer\'92s determination shall be provided to the contractor. When\
the contracting officer determines that the contractor submitted defective cost or pricing data, the contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures, shall ensure that information relating to the contracting officer\'92s final determination is reported in accordance with \cf3 42.1503\cf4 (h). Agencies shall ensure updated information that changes a contracting officer\'92s prior final determination is reported into the FAPIIS module of Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) in the event of a\'97\
(1) Contracting officer\'92s decision in accordance with the Contract Disputes statute; (2) Board of Contract Appeals decision; or\
(3) Court decision.\
(e) If both the contractor and subcontractor submitted, and the contractor certified, or should have certified, cost or\
pricing data, the Government has the right, under the clauses at \cf3 52.215-10\cf4 , Price Reduction for Defective Certified Cost or Pricing Data, and \cf3 52.215-11\cf4 , Price Reduction for Defective Certified Cost or Pricing Data-Modifications, to reduce the prime contract price if it was significantly increased because a subcontractor submitted defective data. This right applies whether these data supported subcontract cost estimates or supported firm agreements between subcontractor and contractor.\
(f) If Government audit discloses defective subcontractor certified cost or pricing data, the information necessary to support a reduction in prime contract and subcontract prices may be available only from the Government. To the extent necessary to secure a prime contract price reduction, the contracting officer should make this information available to the prime contractor or appropriate subcontractors, upon request. If release of the information would compromise Government\

\f1\b0 security or disclose trade secrets or confidential business information, the contracting officer shall release it only under conditions that will protect it from improper disclosure. Information made available under this paragraph shall be limited to that used as the basis for the prime contract price reduction. In order to afford an opportunity for corrective action, the contracting officer should give the prime contractor reasonable advance notice before determining to reduce the prime contract price.\
(1) When a prime contractor includes defective subcontract data in arriving at the price but later awards the subcontract to a lower priced subcontractor (or does not subcontract for the work), any adjustment in the prime contract price due\
to defective subcontract data is limited to the difference (plus applicable indirect cost and profit markups) between the subcontract price used for pricing the prime contract, and either the actual subcontract price or the actual cost to the contractor, if not subcontracted, provided the data on which the actual subcontract price is based are not themselves defective.\
(2) Under cost-reimbursement contracts and under all fixed-price contracts except firm-fixed-price contracts and fixed- price contracts with economic price adjustment, payments to subcontractors that are higher than they would be had there been no defective subcontractor certified cost or pricing data shall be the basis for disallowance or nonrecognition of costs under the clauses prescribed in \cf3 15.408\cf4 (b) and (c). The Government has a continuing and direct financial interest in such payments that is unaffected by the initial agreement on prime contract price.\

\f0\b 15.407-2 Make-or-buy programs.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . The prime contractor is responsible for managing contract performance, including planning, placing, and administering subcontracts as necessary to ensure the lowest overall cost and technical risk to the Government. When make- or-buy programs are required, the Government may reserve the right to review and agree on the contractor\'92s make-or-buy program when necessary to ensure negotiation of reasonable contract prices, satisfactory performance, or implementation of socioeconomic policies. Consent to subcontracts and review of contractors\'92 purchasing systems are separate actions covered in \cf3 part 44\cf4 .\
(b) 
\f2\i Definition. "
\f1\i0 Make item," as used in this subsection, means an item or work effort to be produced or performed by the prime contractor or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or divisions.\
(c) Acquisitions requiring make-or-buy programs. (1) Contracting officers may require prospective contractors to submit make-or-buy program plans for negotiated acquisitions requiring certified cost or pricing data whose estimated value is\
$15 million or more, except when the proposed contract is for research or development and, if prototypes or hardware are involved, no significant follow-on production is anticipated.\
(2) Contracting officers may require prospective contractors to submit make-or-buy programs for negotiated acquisitions whose estimated value is under $15 million only if the contracting officer-\
(i) Determines that the information is necessary; and\
(ii) Documents the reasons in the contract file.\
(d) 
\f2\i Solicitation requirements
\f1\i0 . When prospective contractors are required to submit proposed make-or-buy programs, the\
solicitation shall include-\
(1) A statement that the program and required supporting information must accompany the offer; and\
(2) A description of factors to be used in evaluating the proposed program, such as capability, capacity, availability of\
small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns for subcontracting, establishment of new facilities in or near labor surplus areas, delivery or performance schedules, control of technical and schedule interfaces, proprietary processes, technical superiority or exclusiveness, and technical risks involved.\
(e) 
\f2\i Program requirements
\f1\i0 . To support a make-or-buy program, the following information shall be supplied by the contractor in its proposal:\
(1) 
\f2\i Items and work included
\f1\i0 . The information required from a contractor in a make-or-buy program shall be confined to those major items or work efforts that normally would require company management review of the make-or-buy decision because they are complex, costly, needed in large quantities, or require additional equipment or real property to produce. Raw materials, commercial products, commercial services (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ), and off-the-shelf items (see \cf3 46.101\cf4 ) shall not be included, unless their potential impact on contract cost or schedule is critical. Normally, make-or-buy programs should not include items or work efforts estimated to cost less than 1 percent of the total estimated contract price or any minimum dollar amount set by the agency.\
(2) The offeror\'92s program should include or be supported by the following information:\
(i) A description of each major item or work effort.\
(ii) Categorization of each major item or work effort as "must make," "must buy," or "can either make or buy."\

\fs20 (iii) For each item or work effort categorized as "can either make or buy," a proposal either to "make" or to "buy."\
(iv) Reasons for categorizing items and work efforts as "must make" or "must buy," and proposing to "make" or to "buy" those categorized as "can either make or buy." The reasons must include the consideration given to the evaluation factors described in the solicitation and must be in sufficient detail to permit the contracting officer to evaluate the categorization or proposal.\
(v) Designation of the plant or division proposed to make each item or perform each work effort, and a statement as to whether the existing or proposed new facility is in or near a labor surplus area.\
(vi) Identification of proposed subcontractors, if known, and their location and size status (also see \cf3 subpart 19.7 \cf4 for subcontracting plan requirements).\
(vii) Any recommendations to defer make-or-buy decisions when categorization of some items or work efforts is impracticable at the time of submission.\
(viii) Any other information the contracting officer requires in order to evaluate the program.\
(f) 
\f2\i Evaluation, negotiation, and agreement. 
\f1\i0 Contracting officers shall evaluate and negotiate proposed make-or-buy\
programs as soon as practicable after their receipt and before contract award.\
(1) When the program is to be incorporated in the contract and the design status of the product being acquired does not\
permit accurate precontract identification of major items or work efforts, the contracting officer shall notify the prospective contractor in writing that these items or efforts, when identifiable, shall be added under the clause at \cf3 52.215-9\cf4 , Changes or Additions to Make-or-Buy Program.\
(2) Contracting officers normally shall not agree to proposed "make items" when the products or services are not regularly manufactured or provided by the contractor and are available-quality, quantity, delivery, and other essential\
factors considered-from another firm at equal or lower prices, or when they are regularly manufactured or provided by the contractor, but are available-quality, quantity, delivery, and other essential factors considered-from another firm at lower prices. However, the contracting officer may agree to these as "make items" if an overall lower Governmentwide cost would result or it is otherwise in the best interest of the Government. If this situation occurs in any fixed-price incentive or cost- plus-incentive-fee contract, the contracting officer shall specify these items in the contract and state that they are subject to paragraph (d) of the clause at \cf3 52.215-9\cf4 , Changes or Additions to Make-or-Buy Program (see \cf3 15.408\cf4 (a)). If the contractor proposes to reverse the categorization of such items during contract performance, the contract price shall be subject to equitable reduction.\
(g) 
\f2\i Incorporating make-or-buy programs in contracts
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer may incorporate the make-or-buy program in negotiated contracts for-\
(1) Major systems (see \cf3 part 34\cf4 ) or their subsystems or components, regardless of contract type; or (2) Other supplies and services if-\
(i) The contract is a cost-reimbursable contract, or a cost-sharing contract in which the contractor\'92s share of the cost is less than 25 percent; and\
(ii) The contracting officer determines that technical or cost risks justify Government review and approval of changes or additions to the make-or-buy program.\

\f0\b 15.407-3 Forward pricing rate agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) When certified cost or pricing data are required, offerors are required to describe any forward pricing rate agreements (FPRAs) in each specific pricing proposal to which the rates apply and to identify the latest cost or pricing data already submitted in accordance with the FPRA. All data submitted in connection with the FPRA, updated as necessary, form a part of the total data that the offeror certifies to be accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price for an initial contract or for a contract modification. (See the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data at \cf3 15.406-2\cf4 .)\
(b) Contracting officers will use FPRA rates as bases for pricing all contracts, modifications, and other contractual actions to be performed during the period covered by the agreement. Conditions that may affect the agreement\'92s validity shall be reported promptly to the ACO. If the ACO determines that a changed condition invalidates the agreement, the ACO shall notify all interested parties of the extent of its effect and status of efforts to establish a revised FPRA.\
(c) Contracting officers shall not require certification at the time of agreement for data supplied in support of FPRA\'92s or other advance agreements. When a forward pricing rate agreement or other advance agreement is used to price a contract action that requires a certificate, the certificate supporting that contract action shall cover the data supplied to support the FPRA or other advance agreement, and all other data supporting the action.\

 15.407-4 Should-cost review.\

\f1\b0 (a) General. (1) Should-cost reviews are a specialized form of cost analysis. Should-cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation methods because they do not assume that a contractor\'92s historical costs reflect efficient and economical operation. Instead, these reviews evaluate the economy and efficiency of the contractor\'92s existing work force, methods, materials, equipment, real property, operating systems, and management. These reviews are accomplished by a multi-functional team of Government contracting, contract administration, pricing, audit, and engineering representatives. The objective of should- cost reviews is to promote both short and long-range improvements in the contractor\'92s economy and efficiency in order to reduce the cost of performance of Government contracts. In addition, by providing rationale for any recommendations and quantifying their impact on cost, the Government will be better able to develop realistic objectives for negotiation.\
(2) There are two types of should-cost reviews-program should-cost review (see paragraph (b) of this subsection) and overhead should-cost review (see paragraph (c) of this subsection). These should-cost reviews may be performed together or independently. The scope of a should-cost review can range from a large-scale review examining the contractor\'92s entire operation (including plant-wide overhead and selected major subcontractors) to a small-scale tailored review examining specific portions of a contractor\'92s operation.\
(b) Program should-cost review. (1) A program should-cost review is used to evaluate significant elements of direct costs, such as material and labor, and associated indirect costs, usually associated with the production of major systems. When a program should-cost review is conducted relative to a contractor proposal, a separate audit report on the proposal is required.\
(2) A program should-cost review should be considered, particularly in the case of a major system acquisition (see \cf3 part 34\cf4 ), when-\
(i) Some initial production has already taken place;\
(ii) The contract will be awarded on a sole source basis;\
(iii) There are future year production requirements for substantial quantities of like items;\
(iv) The items being acquired have a history of increasing costs;\
(v) The work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective analysis and major changes are unlikely;\
(vi) Sufficient time is available to plan and adequately conduct the should-cost review; and\
(vii) Personnel with the required skills are available or can be assigned for the duration of the should-cost review.\
(3) The contracting officer should decide which elements of the contractor\'92s operation have the greatest potential for cost savings and assign the available personnel resources accordingly. The expertise of on-site Government personnel should be used, when appropriate. While the particular elements to be analyzed are a function of the contract work task, elements such as manufacturing, pricing and accounting, management and organization, and subcontract and vendor management are normally reviewed in a should-cost review.\
(4) In acquisitions for which a program should-cost review is conducted, a separate program should-cost review team report, prepared in accordance with agency procedures, is required. The contracting officer shall consider the findings and recommendations contained in the program should-cost review team report when negotiating the contract price.\
After completing the negotiation, the contracting officer shall provide the ACO a report of any identified uneconomical\
or inefficient practices, together with a report of correction or disposition agreements reached with the contractor. The contracting officer shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.\
(5) When a program should-cost review is planned, the contracting officer should state this fact in the acquisition plan or acquisition plan updates (see \cf3 subpart 7.1\cf4 ) and in the solicitation.\
(c) Overhead should-cost review. (1) An overhead should- cost review is used to evaluate indirect costs, such as fringe benefits, shipping and receiving, real property, and equipment, depreciation, plant maintenance and security, taxes, and general and administrative activities. It is normally used to evaluate and negotiate an FPRA with the contractor. When an overhead should-cost review is conducted, a separate audit report is required.\
(2) The following factors should be considered when selecting contractor sites for overhead should-cost reviews: (i) Dollar amount of Government business.\
(ii) Level of Government participation.\
(iii) Level of noncompetitive Government contracts.\
(iv) Volume of proposal activity.\
(v) Major system or program.\
(vi) Corporate reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers.\
(vii) Other conditions (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 changes in accounting systems, management, or business activity).\
(3) The objective of the overhead should-cost review is to evaluate significant indirect cost elements in-depth, and identify and recommend corrective actions regarding inefficient and uneconomical practices. If it is conducted in conjunction\

\fs20 with a program should-cost review, a separate overhead should-cost review report is not required. However, the findings and recommendations of the overhead should-cost team, or any separate overhead should-cost review report, shall be provided to the ACO. The ACO should use this information to form the basis for the Government position in negotiating an FPRA with the contractor. The ACO shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.\

\f0\b 15.407-5 Estimating systems.\

\f1\b0 (a) Using an acceptable estimating system for proposal preparation benefits both the Government and the contractor by increasing the accuracy and reliability of individual proposals. Cognizant audit activities, when it is appropriate to do so, shall establish and manage regular programs for reviewing selected contractors\'92 estimating systems or methods, in order to reduce the scope of reviews to be performed on individual proposals, expedite the negotiation process, and increase the reliability of proposals. The results of estimating system reviews shall be documented in survey reports.\
(b) The auditor shall send a copy of the estimating system survey report and a copy of the official notice of corrective action required to each contracting office and contract administration office having substantial business with that contractor. Significant deficiencies not corrected by the contractor shall be a consideration in subsequent proposal analyses and negotiations.\

\f0\b 15.408 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Changes or Additions to Make-or-Buy Program
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.215-9, Changes or Additions to Make-or-Buy Program, in solicitations and contracts when it is contemplated that a make-or-buy program will be incorporated in the contract. If a less economical "make" or "buy" categorization is selected for one or more items of significant value, the contracting officer shall use the clause with-\
(1) Its Alternate I, if a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated; or\
(2) Its Alternate II, if a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is contemplated.\
(b) 
\f2\i Price Reduction for Defective Certified Cost or Pricing Data

\f0\b Table 15-2\'97Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing Data Are Required\

\f1\b0 This document provides instructions for preparing a contract pricing proposal when certified cost or pricing data are required.\

\f2\i Note 
\f1\i0 1. There is a clear distinction between submitting certified cost or pricing data and merely making available books, records, and other documents without identification. The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing\
data is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative. As later data come into your possession, it should be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that clearly shows how the data relate\
to the offeror\'92s price proposal. The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date agreed upon between the parties if applicable.\

\f2\i Note 2
\f1\i0 . By submitting your proposal, you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award. It may include those books, records, documents, and other types of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing) that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.\
I. General Instructions\

\f1\i0 . Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual material quantities included\
in the various tasks, orders, or line items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies, and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price. Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR \cf3 15.403-4\cf4 . Submit the subcontractor certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified cost or pricing data.\

\f2\i Adequate Price Competition. 
\f1\i0 Provide data showing the degree of competition and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate threshold set forth at FAR \cf3 15.403-4 \cf4 priced on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR \cf3 31.205-26\cf4 (e)).\
(2) 
\f2\i All Other
\f1\i0 . Obtain certified cost or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding the threshold set forth in FAR \cf3 15.403-4 \cf4 and not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (b) ( 
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , adequate price competition, commercial products or commercial services, prices set by law or regulation or waiver).

Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime contractor\'92s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor\'92s data. For standard commercial products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked\
in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective source\'92s proposal.When submission of a prospective source\'92s certified cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph, it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by specific identification, along with the results of any analysis performed on that data.\

\f1\b0 (6) Enter the difference between the contract amount and the redetermination proposal amount. When this result is negative, place the amount in parentheses. Column (4) minus Column (5) equals Column (6).\
(7) Enter appropriate cost elements. When residual inventory exists, the final costs established under fixed-price-incentive and fixed-price-redeterminable arrangements should be net of the fair market value of such inventory. In support of subcontract costs, submit a listing of\
all subcontracts subject to repricing action, annotated as to their status.\
(8) Enter all costs incurred under the contract before starting production and other nonrecurring costs (usually referred to as startup costs) from your books and records as of the cutoff date. These include such costs as preproduction engineering, special plant rearrangement, training program, and any identifiable nonrecurring costs such as initial rework, spoilage, pilot runs, etc. In the event the amounts are not segregated in or otherwise available from your records, enter in this column your best estimates. Explain the basis for each estimate and how the costs are charged on your accounting records (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 included in production costs as direct engineering labor, charged to manufacturing overhead). Also show how the costs would be allocated to the units at their various stages of contract completion.\
(9) Enter in Column (9) the production costs from your books and records (exclusive of preproduction costs reported in Column (8)) of the units completed as of the cutoff date.\
(10) Enter in Column (10) the costs of work in process as determined from your records or inventories at the cutoff date. When the amounts for work in process are not available in\
your records but reliable estimates for them can be made, enter the estimated amounts\
in Column (10) and enter in column (9) the differences between the total incurred costs (exclusive of preproduction costs) as of the cutoff date and these estimates. Explain the basis for the estimates, including identification of any provision for experienced or anticipated allowances, such as shrinkage, rework, design changes, etc. Furnish experienced unit or lot costs (or labor hours) from inception of contract to the cutoff date, improvement curves, and any other available production cost history pertaining to the item(s) to which your proposal relates.\
(11) Enter total incurred costs (Total of Columns (8), (9), and (10)).\
(12) Enter those necessary and reasonable costs that in your judgment will properly be incurred in completing the remaining work to be performed under the contract with respect to the\
item(s) to which your proposal relates.\
(13) Enter total estimated cost (Total of Columns (11) and (12)).\
(14) Identify the attachment in which the information supporting the specific cost element may be found.\

The rationale for delaying the debriefing shall be documented in the contract file. If the contracting officer delays the debriefing, it shall be provided no later than the time postaward debriefings are provided under \cf3 15.506\cf4 . In that event, the contracting officer shall include the information at \cf3 15.506\cf4 (d) in the debriefing.\
(c) Debriefings may be done orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.\

(2) A summary of the rationale for eliminating the offeror from the competition; and\
(3) Reasonable responses to relevant questions about whether source selection procedures contained in the solicitation,\
applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed in the process of eliminating the offeror from the competition.\

(2) To the maximum extent practicable, the debriefing should occur within 5 days after receipt of the written request. Offerors that requested a postaward debriefing in lieu of a preaward debriefing, or whose debriefing was delayed for compelling reasons beyond contract award, also should be debriefed within this time period.\
(3) An offeror that was notified of exclusion from the competition (see \cf3 15.505\cf4 (a)), but failed to submit a timely request, is not entitled to a debriefing.\

\f1\b0 (ii) Government accommodation of a request for delayed debriefing pursuant to \cf3 15.505\cf4 (a)(2), or any untimely debriefing request, does not automatically extend the deadlines for filing protests. Debriefings delayed pursuant to \cf3 15.505\cf4 (a) (2) could affect the timeliness of any protest filed subsequent to the debriefing.\
(b) Debriefings of successful and unsuccessful offerors may be done orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.\
(c) The contracting officer should normally chair any debriefing session held. Individuals who conducted the evaluations shall provide support.\

(1) Trade secrets;\
(2) Privileged or confidential manufacturing processes and techniques;\
(3) Commercial and financial information that is privileged or confidential, including cost breakdowns, profit, indirect\
cost rates, and similar information; and\
(4) The names of individuals providing reference information about an offeror\'92s past performance.\
(f) An official summary of the debriefing shall be included in the contract file.\

\f0\b 15.507 Protests against award.\

\f1\b0 (a) Protests against award in negotiated acquisitions shall be handled in accordance with \cf3 part 33\cf4 . Use of agency protest procedures that incorporate the alternative dispute resolution provisions of Executive Order12979 is encouraged for both preaward and postaward protests.\
(b) If a protest causes the agency, within 1 year of contract award, to-\

(b) Advertising material, commercial product or commercial service offers, or contributions, as defined in \cf3 15.601\cf4 , or routine correspondence on technical issues, are not unsolicited proposals.\
(c) A valid unsolicited proposal must-\

(d) Unsolicited proposals in response to a publicized general statement of agency needs are considered to be independently originated.\
(e) Agencies must evaluate unsolicited proposals for \cf2 energy savings performance contracts in accordance with the procedures in 10 CFR436.33(b).\

\f0\b 15.604 Agency points of contact.\

\f1\b0 (a) Preliminary contact with agency technical or other appropriate personnel before preparing a detailed unsolicited proposal or submitting proprietary information to the Government may save considerable time and effort for both parties (see \cf3 15.201\cf4 ). Agencies must make available to potential offerors of unsolicited proposals at least the following information:\
(1) Definition (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ) and content (see \cf3 15.605\cf4 ) of an unsolicited proposal acceptable for formal evaluation.\

critical to achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) The realism of the proposed cost.\
(b) The evaluators shall notify the agency point of contact of their recommendations when the evaluation is completed.\

\f0\b 15.607 Criteria for acceptance and negotiation of an unsolicited proposal.\

\f1\b0 (a) A favorable comprehensive evaluation of an unsolicited proposal does not, in itself, justify awarding a contract without providing for full and open competition. The agency point of contact shall return an unsolicited proposal to the offeror, citing reasons, when its substance-\

(2) Closely resembles a pending competitive acquisition requirement;\
(3) Does not relate to the activity\'92s mission; or\
(4) Does not demonstrate an innovative and unique method, approach, or concept, or is otherwise not deemed a\
meritorious proposal.\
(b) The contracting officer may commence negotiations on a sole source basis only when-\
(1) An unsolicited proposal has received a favorable comprehensive evaluation;\
(2) A justification and approval has been obtained (see \cf3 6.302-1\cf4 (a)(2)(i) for research proposals or other appropriate provisions of \cf3 subpart 6.3\cf4 , and \cf3 6.303-2\cf4 (c));\

\f0\b 15.608 Prohibitions.\

\f1\b0 (a) Government personnel shall not use any data, concept, idea, or other part of an unsolicited proposal as the basis, or part of the basis, for a solicitation or in negotiations with any other firm unless the offeror is notified of and agrees to the intended use. However, this prohibition does not preclude using any data, concept, or idea in the proposal that also is available from another source without restriction.\
(b) Government personnel shall not disclose restrictively marked information (see \cf3 3.104 \cf4 and \cf3 15.609\cf4 ) included in an unsolicited proposal. The disclosure of such information concerning trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, apparatus, and other matters, except as authorized by law, may result in criminal penalties under \cf3 18 U.S.C.1905\cf4 .\

This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in these data if they are obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in Sheets [
\f2\i insert numbers or other identification of sheets
\f1\i0 ].\
(b) The offeror shall also mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.\
(c) The agency point of contact shall return to the offeror any unsolicited proposal marked with a legend different from that provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The return letter will state that the proposal cannot be considered because it is impracticable for the Government to comply with the legend and that the agency will consider the proposal if it is resubmitted with the proper legend.\
(d) The agency point of contact shall place a cover sheet on the proposal or clearly mark it as follows, unless the offeror clearly states in writing that no restrictions are imposed on the disclosure or use of the data contained in the proposal:\

\f2\i Unsolicited Proposal-Use of Data Limited\

\f1\i0 All Government personnel must exercise extreme care to ensure that the information in this proposal is not disclosed to an individual who has not been authorized access to such data in accordance with FAR \cf3 3.104\cf4 , and is not duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal, without the written permission of the offeror. If a contract is awarded on the basis of this proposal, the terms of the contract shall control disclosure and use. This notice does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in the proposal if it is obtainable from another source without restriction. This is a Government notice, and shall not by itself be construed to impose any liability upon the Government or Government personnel for disclosure or use of data contained in this proposal.\
(e) Use the notice in paragraph (d) of this section solely as a manner of handling unsolicited proposals that will be compatible with this subpart. However, do not use this notice to justify withholding of a record, or to improperly deny\
the public access to a record, where an obligation is imposed by the Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C. 552\cf4 ). An offeror should identify trade secrets, commercial or financial information, and privileged or confidential information to the Government (see paragraph (a) of this section).\
(f) When an agency receives an unsolicited proposal without any restrictive legend from an educational or nonprofit organization or institution, and an evaluation outside the Government is necessary, the agency point of contact shall-\
(1) Attach a cover sheet clearly marked with the legend in paragraph (d) of this section;\
(2) Change the beginning of this legend to read "All Government and non-Government personnel * * *"; and\
(3) Require any non-Government evaluator to agree in writing that data in the proposal will not be disclosed to others\
outside the Government.\
(g) If the proposal is received with the restrictive legend (see paragraph (a) of this section), the modified cover sheet\
shall also be used and permission shall be obtained from the offeror before release of the proposal for evaluation by non- Government personnel.\
(h) When an agency receives an unsolicited proposal with or without a restrictive legend from other than an educational or nonprofit organization or institution, and evaluation by Government personnel outside the agency or by experts outside of the Government is necessary, written permission must be obtained from the offeror before release of the proposal for evaluation. The agency point of contact shall-\
(1) Clearly mark the cover sheet with the legend in paragraph (d) or as modified in paragraph (f) of this section; and\
(2) Obtain a written agreement from any non-Government evaluator stating that data in the proposal will not be disclosed to persons outside the Government.\

 16.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part describes types of contracts that may be used in acquisitions. It prescribes policies and procedures and provides guidance for selecting a contract type appropriate to the circumstances of the acquisition.\

\f0\b 16.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Award-Fee Board 
\f1\i0 means the team of individuals identified in the award-fee plan who have been designated to assist the Fee-Determining Official in making award-fee determinations.\

\f2\i Established price 
\f1\i0 means a price that\'97\
(1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general\
public; and\
(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the contractor.\

\f2\i Fee-Determining Official (FDO) 
\f1\i0 means the designated Agency official(s) who reviews the recommendations of the Award-Fee Board in determining the amount of award fee to be earned by the contractor for each evaluation period.\

\f2\i Rollover of unearned award fee 
\f1\i0 means the process of transferring unearned award fee, which the contractor had an opportunity to earn, from one evaluation period to a subsequent evaluation period, thus allowing the contractor an additional opportunity to earn that previously unearned award fee.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 16.1 - Selecting Contract Types\

\fs20 16.101 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) A wide selection of contract types is available to the Government and contractors in order to provide needed flexibility in acquiring the large variety and volume of supplies and services required by agencies. Contract types vary according to-\
(1) The degree and timing of the responsibility assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance; and\
(2) The amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals.\
(b) The contract types are grouped into two broad categories: fixed-price contracts (see \cf3 subpart 16.2\cf4 ) and cost- reimbursement contracts (see \cf3 subpart 16.3\cf4 ). The specific contract types range from firm-fixed-price, in which the contractor has full responsibility for the performance costs and resulting profit (or loss), to cost-plus-fixed-fee, in which the contractor has minimal responsibility for the performance costs and the negotiated fee (profit) is fixed. In between are the various incentive contracts (see \cf3 subpart 16.4\cf4 ), in which the contractor\'92s responsibility for the performance costs and the profit or fee incentives offered are tailored to the uncertainties involved in contract performance.\

\f0\b 16.102 Policies.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracts resulting from sealed bidding shall be firm-fixed-price contracts or fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment.\
(b) Contracts negotiated under \cf3 part 15 \cf4 may be of any type or combination of types that will promote the Government\'92s interest, except as restricted in this part (see \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3321(a) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3901\cf4 ). Contract types not described in this regulation shall not be used, except as a deviation under \cf3 subpart 1.4\cf4 .\
(c) The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting shall not be used (see \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3322(a) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3905(a)\cf4 ). Prime contracts (including letter contracts) other than firm-fixed-price contracts shall, by an appropriate clause, prohibit cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost subcontracts (see clauses prescribed in \cf3 subpart 44.2 \cf4 for cost-reimbursement contracts and \cf3 subparts 16.2 \cf4 and \cf3 16.4 \cf4 for fixed-price contracts).\
(d) No contract may be awarded before the execution of any determination and findings (D&F\'92s) required by this part. Minimum requirements for the content of D&F\'92s required by this part are specified in \cf3 1.704\cf4 .\

\f0\b 16.103 Negotiating contract type.\

\f1\b0 (a) Selecting the contract type is generally a matter for negotiation and requires the exercise of sound judgment. Negotiating the contract type and negotiating prices are closely related and should be considered together. The objective is to negotiate a contract type and price (or estimated cost and fee) that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.\
(b) A firm-fixed-price contract, which best utilizes the basic profit motive of business enterprise, shall be used when the risk involved is minimal or can be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. However, when a reasonable basis for\

\f1\b0 F
\fs16 EDERAL 
\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 firm pricing does not exist, other contract types should be considered, and negotiations should be directed toward selecting a contract type (or combination of types) that will appropriately tie profit to contractor performance.\
(c) In the course of an acquisition program, a series of contracts, or a single long-term contract, changing circumstances may make a different contract type appropriate in later periods than that used at the outset. In particular, contracting officers should avoid protracted use of a cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials contract after experience provides a basis for firmer pricing.\
(d) (1) Each contract file shall include documentation to show why the particular contract type was selected. This shall be documented in the acquisition plan, or in the contract file if a written acquisition plan is not required by agency procedures.\
(i) Explain why the contract type selected must be used to meet the agency need.\
(ii) Discuss the Government\'92s additional risks and the burden to manage the contract type selected (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , when a cost-reimbursement contract is selected, the Government incurs additional cost risks, and the Government has the additional burden of managing the contractor\'92s costs). For such instances, acquisition personnel shall discuss
\f2\i  
\f1\i0 \'96\
(A) How the Government identified the additional risks (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , pre-award survey, or past performance information);\
(B) The nature of the additional risks (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , inadequate contractor\'92s accounting system, weaknesses in contractor's internal control, non-compliance with Cost Accounting Standards, or lack of or inadequate earned value management system); and\
(C) How the Government will manage and mitigate the risks.\
(iii) Discuss the Government resources necessary to properly plan for, award, and administer the contract type\
selected (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , resources needed and the additional risks to the Government if adequate resources are not provided). (iv) For other than a firm-fixed price contract, at a minimum the documentation should include
\f2\i  
\f1\i0 \'96\
(A) An analysis of why the use of other than a firm-fixed-price contract (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , cost reimbursement, time and materials, labor hour) is appropriate;\
(B) Rationale that detail the particular facts and circumstances (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , complexity of the requirements, uncertain duration of the work, contractor\'92s technical capability and financial responsibility, or adequacy of the contractor\'92s accounting system), and associated reasoning essential to support the contract type selection;\
(C) An assessment regarding the adequacy of Government resources that are necessary to properly plan for, award, and administer other than firm-fixed-price contracts; and\
(D) A discussion of the actions planned to minimize the use of other than firm-fixed-price contracts on future acquisitions for the same requirement and to transition to firm-fixed-price contracts to the maximum extent practicable.\
(v) A discussion of why a level-of-effort, price redetermination, or fee provision was included. (2) Exceptions to the requirements at (d)(1) of this section are
\f2\i  
\f1\i0 \'96\
(i) Fixed-price acquisitions made under simplified acquisition procedures;\
(ii) Contracts on a firm-fixed-price basis other than those for major systems or research and development; and (iii) Awards on the set-aside portion of sealed bid partial set-asides for small business.\

\f0\b 16.104 Factors in selecting contract types.\

\f1\b0 There are many factors that the contracting officer should consider in selecting and negotiating the contract type. They include the following:\
(a) 
\f2\i Price competition
\f1\i0 . Normally, effective price competition results in realistic pricing, and a fixed-price contract is ordinarily in the Government\'92s interest.\
(b) 
\f2\i Price analysis
\f1\i0 . Price analysis, with or without competition, may provide a basis for selecting the contract type. The degree to which price analysis can provide a realistic pricing standard should be carefully considered. (See \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (b).)\
(c) 
\f2\i Cost analysis
\f1\i0 . In the absence of effective price competition and if price analysis is not sufficient, the cost estimates\
of the offeror and the Government provide the bases for negotiating contract pricing arrangements. It is essential that the uncertainties involved in performance and their possible impact upon costs be identified and evaluated, so that a contract type that places a reasonable degree of cost responsibility upon the contractor can be negotiated.\
(d) 
\f2\i Type and complexity of the requirement
\f1\i0 . Complex requirements, particularly those unique to the Government, usually result in greater risk assumption by the Government. This is especially true for complex research and development contracts, when performance uncertainties or the likelihood of changes makes it difficult to estimate performance costs in advance. As a requirement recurs or as quantity production begins, the cost risk should shift to the contractor, and a fixed-price contract should be considered.\

\f0\b\fs20 16.105\
 
\f1\b0 (e) 
\f2\i Combining contract types
\f1\i0 . If the entire contract cannot be firm-fixed-price, the contracting officer shall consider whether or not a portion of the contract can be established on a firm-fixed-price basis.\
(f) 
\f2\i Urgency of the requirement
\f1\i0 . If urgency is a primary factor, the Government may choose to assume a greater proportion of risk or it may offer incentives tailored to performance outcomes to ensure timely contract performance.\
(g) 
\f2\i Period of performance or length of production run
\f1\i0 . In times of economic uncertainty, contracts extending over a relatively long period may require economic price adjustment or price redetermination clauses.\
(h) 
\f2\i Contractor\'92s technical capability and financial responsibility
\f1\i0 .\
(i) 
\f2\i Adequacy of the contractor's accounting system
\f1\i0 . Before agreeing on a contract type other than firm-fixed-price, the contracting officer shall ensure that the contractor\'92s accounting system will permit timely development of all necessary cost data in the form required by the proposed contract type. This factor may be critical\'96\
(1) When the contract type requires price revision while performance is in progress; or\
(2) When a cost-reimbursement contract is being considered and all current or past experience with the contractor has been on a fixed-price basis. See \cf3 42.302\cf4 (a)(12).\
(j) 
\f2\i Concurrent contracts
\f1\i0 . If performance under the proposed contract involves concurrent operations under other contracts, the impact of those contracts, including their pricing arrangements, should be considered.\
(k) 
\f2\i Extent and nature of proposed subcontracting
\f1\i0 . If the contractor proposes extensive subcontracting, a contract type reflecting the actual risks to the prime contractor should be selected.\
(l) 
\f2\i Acquisition history
\f1\i0 . Contractor risk usually decreases as the requirement is repetitively acquired. Also, product descriptions or descriptions of services to be performed can be defined more clearly.\

\f0\b 16.105 Solicitation provision.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall complete and insert the provision at \cf3 52.216-1\cf4 , Type of Contract, in a solicitation unless it is for-\
(a) A fixed-price acquisition made under simplified acquisition procedures; or (b) Information or planning purposes.\

\fs24 Subpart 16.2 - Fixed-Price Contracts\

\fs20 16.201 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Fixed-price types of contracts provide for a firm price or, in appropriate cases, an adjustable price. Fixed-price contracts providing for an adjustable price may include a ceiling price, a target price (including target cost), or both. Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the ceiling price or target price is subject to adjustment only by operation of contract clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the contract price under stated circumstances. The contracting officer shall use firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts when acquiring commercial products and commercial services, except as provided in \cf3 12.207\cf4 (b).\
(b) Time-and-materials contracts and labor-hour contracts are not fixed-price contracts.\

\f0\b 16.202 Firm-fixed-price contracts.\
16.202-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor\'92s cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative burden upon the contracting parties. The contracting officer may use a firm-fixed- price contract in conjunction with an award-fee incentive (see \cf3 16.404\cf4 ) and performance or delivery incentives (see \cf3 16.402-2 \cf4 and \cf3 16.402-3\cf4 ) when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost. The contract type remains firm- fixed-price when used with these incentives.\

\f0\b 16.202-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 A firm-fixed-price contract is suitable for acquiring commercial products or commercial services (see \cf3 parts 2 \cf4 and \cf3 12\cf4 ) or for acquiring other supplies or services on the basis of reasonably definite functional or detailed specifications (see \cf3 part 11\cf4 ) when the contracting officer can establish fair and reasonable prices at the outset, such as when-\
(a) There is adequate price competition;\
(b) There are reasonable price comparisons with prior purchases of the same or similar supplies or services made on a competitive basis or supported by valid certified cost or pricing data;\
(c) Available cost or pricing information permits realistic estimates of the probable costs of performance; or\
(d) Performance uncertainties can be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impact can be made, and the contractor is willing to accept a firm fixed price representing assumption of the risks involved.\

\f0\b 16.203 Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment.\
16.203-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 (a) A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment provides for upward and downward revision of the stated contract price upon the occurrence of specified contingencies. Economic price adjustments are of three general types:\
(1) 
\f2\i Adjustments based on established prices. 
\f1\i0 These price adjustments are based on increases or decreases from an agreed-upon level in published or otherwise established prices of specific items or the contract end items.\
(2) 
\f2\i Adjustments based on actual costs of labor or material
\f1\i0 . These price adjustments are based on increases or decreases in specified costs of labor or material that the contractor actually experiences during contract performance.\
(3) 
\f2\i Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material
\f1\i0 . These price adjustments are based on increases or decreases in labor or material cost standards or indexes that are specifically identified in the contract.\
(b) The contracting officer may use a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment in conjunction with an award- fee incentive (see \cf3 16.404\cf4 ) and performance or delivery incentives (see \cf3 16.402-2 \cf4 and \cf3 16.402-3\cf4 ) when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost. The contract type remains fixed-price with economic price adjustment when used with these incentives.\

\f0\b 16.203-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment may be used when (i) there is serious doubt concerning the stability of market or labor conditions that will exist during an extended period of contract performance, and (ii) contingencies that would otherwise be included in the contract price can be identified and covered separately in the contract. Price adjustments\

\fs20 based on established prices should normally be restricted to industry-wide contingencies. Price adjustments based on labor and material costs should be limited to contingencies beyond the contractor\'92s control. For use of economic price adjustment in sealed bid contracts, see \cf3 14.408-4\cf4 .\
(a) In establishing the base level from which adjustment will be made, the contracting officer shall ensure that contingency allowances are not duplicated by inclusion in both the base price and the adjustment requested by the contractor under economic price adjustment clause.\
(b) In contracts that do not require submission of certified cost or pricing data, the contracting officer shall obtain adequate data to establish the base level from which adjustment will be made and may require verification of data submitted.\

\f0\b 16.203-3 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment shall not be used unless the contracting officer determines that it is necessary either to protect the contractor and the Government against significant fluctuations in labor or material costs or to provide for contract price adjustment in the event of changes in the contractor\'92s established prices.\

\f0\b 16.203-4 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Adjustment based on established prices-standard supplies. (1) The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-2\cf4 , Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies, or an agency-prescribed clause as authorized in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection, in solicitations and contracts when all of the following conditions apply:\
(i) A fixed-price contract is contemplated.\
(ii) The requirement is for standard supplies that have an established catalog or market price. (iii) The contracting officer has made the determination specified in \cf3 16.203-3\cf4 .\
(2) If all the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection apply and the contracting officer determines that the use of the clause at \cf3 52.216-2 \cf4 is inappropriate, the contracting officer may use an agency-prescribed clause instead of the clause at \cf3 52.216-2\cf4 .\
(3) If the negotiated unit price reflects a net price after applying a trade discount from a catalog or list price, the contracting officer shall document in the contract file both the catalog or list price and the discount. (This does not apply to prompt payment or cash discounts.)\
(4) The contracting officer may modify the clause by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in \cf3 52.216-2\cf4 (c)(1), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office.\
(b) Adjustment based on established prices-semistandard supplies. (1) The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-3\cf4 , Economic Price Adjustment-Semistandard Supplies, or an agency-prescribed clause as authorized in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in solicitations and contracts when all of the following conditions apply:\
(i) A fixed-price contract is contemplated.\
(ii) The requirement is for semistandard supplies for which the prices can be reasonably related to the prices of nearly equivalent standard supplies that have an established catalog or market price.\
(iii) The contracting officer has made the determination specified in \cf3 16.203-3\cf4 .\
(2) If all conditions in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection apply and the contracting officer determines that the use of\
the clause at \cf3 52.216-3 \cf4 is inappropriate, the contracting officer may use an agency-prescribed clause instead of the clause at \cf3 52.216-3\cf4 .\
(3) If the negotiated unit price reflects a net price after applying a trade discount from a catalog or list price, the contracting officer shall document in the contract file both the catalog or list price and the discount. (This does not apply to prompt payment or cash discounts.)\
(4) Before entering into the contract, the contracting officer and contractor must agree in writing on the identity of the standard supplies and the corresponding line items to which the clause applies.\
(5) If the supplies are standard, except for preservation, packaging, and packing requirements, the clause prescribed in \cf3 16.203-4\cf4 (a) shall be used rather than this clause.\
(6) The contracting officer may modify the clause by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in \cf3 52.216-3\cf4 (c)(1), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office.\
(c) Adjustments based on actual cost of labor or material. (1) The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, insert a clause that is substantially the same as the clause at \cf3 52.216-4\cf4 , Economic Price Adjustment -Labor and Material, or an agency-prescribed clause as authorized in subparagraph (c)(2) of this section, in solicitations and contracts when all of the following conditions apply:\

\f1\b0 (ii) There is no major element of design engineering or development work involved. (iii) One or more identifiable labor or material cost factors are subject to change. (iv) The contracting officer has made the determination specified in \cf3 16.203-3\cf4 .\
(2) If all conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply and the contracting officer determines that the use of the clause at \cf3 52.216-4 \cf4 is inappropriate, the contracting officer may use an agency-prescribed clause instead of the clause at \cf3 52.216-4\cf4 .\
(3) The contracting officer shall describe in detail in the contract Schedule-\
(i) The types of labor and materials subject to adjustment under the clause;\
(ii) The labor rates, including fringe benefits (if any) and unit prices of materials that may be increased or decreased;\
and\
(iii) The quantities of the specified labor and materials allocable to each unit to be delivered under the contract.\
(4) In negotiating adjustments under the clause, the contracting officer shall-\
(i) Consider work in process and materials on hand at the time of changes in labor rates, including fringe benefits (if\
any) or material prices;\
(ii) Not include in adjustments any indirect cost (except fringe benefits as defined in \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 (m)) or profit; and (iii) Consider only those fringe benefits specified in the contract Schedule.\
(5) The contracting officer may modify the clause by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in \cf3 52.216-4\cf4 (c)(4), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office.\
(d) 
\f2\i Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer should consider using an economic price adjustment clause based on cost indexes of labor or material under the circumstances and subject to approval as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.\
(1) A clause providing adjustment based on cost indexes of labor or materials may be appropriate when-\
(i) The contract involves an extended period of performance with significant costs to be incurred beyond 1 year after\
performance begins;\
(ii) The contract amount subject to adjustment is substantial; and\
(iii) The economic variables for labor and materials are too unstable to permit a reasonable division of risk between\
the Government and the contractor, without this type of clause.\
(2) Any clause using this method shall be prepared and approved under agency procedures. Because of the variations in\
circumstances and clause wording that may arise, no standard clause is prescribed.\

\f0\b 16.204 Fixed-price incentive contracts.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-price incentive contract is a fixed-price contract that provides for adjusting profit and establishing the final contract price by a formula based on the relationship of final negotiated total cost to total target cost. Fixed-price incentive contracts are covered in \cf3 subpart 16.4\cf4 , Incentive Contracts. See \cf3 16.403 \cf4 for more complete descriptions, application, and limitations for these contracts. Prescribed clauses are found at \cf3 16.406\cf4 .\

\f0\b 16.205 Fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination.\
16.205-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination provides for-\
(a) A firm fixed price for an initial period of contract deliveries or performance; and\
(b) Prospective redetermination, at a stated time or times during performance, of the price for subsequent periods of\
performance.\

\f0\b 16.205-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination may be used in acquisitions of quantity production or services for which it is possible to negotiate a fair and reasonable firm fixed price for an initial period, but not for subsequent periods of contract performance.\
(a) The initial period should be the longest period for which it is possible to negotiate a fair and reasonable firm fixed price. Each subsequent pricing period should be at least 12 months.\
(b) The contract may provide for a ceiling price based on evaluation of the uncertainties involved in performance and their possible cost impact. This ceiling price should provide for assumption of a reasonable proportion of the risk by the contractor\

revision of the contract price under stated circumstances.\

\f0\b 16.205-3 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 This contract type shall not be used unless- (a) Negotiations have established that-\
(1) The conditions for use of a firm-fixed-price contract are not present (see \cf3 16.202-2\cf4 ); and\
(2) A fixed-price incentive contract would not be more appropriate;\
(b) The contractor\'92s accounting system is adequate for price redetermination;\
(c) The prospective pricing periods can be made to conform with operation of the contractor\'92s accounting system; and (d) There is reasonable assurance that price redetermination actions will take place promptly at the specified times.\

\f0\b 16.205-4 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-5\cf4 , Price Redetermination- Prospective, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price contract is contemplated and the conditions specified in \cf3 16.205-2 \cf4 and \cf3 16.205-3\cf4 (a) through (d) apply.\

\f0\b 16.206 Fixed-ceiling-price contracts with retroactive price redetermination.\
16.206-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination provides for-\
(a) A fixed ceiling price; and\
(b) Retroactive price redetermination within the ceiling after completion of the contract.\

\f0\b 16.206-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 A fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is appropriate for research and development contracts estimated at the simplified acquisition threshold or less when it is established at the outset that a fair and reasonable firm fixed price cannot be negotiated and that the amount involved and short performance period make the use of any other fixed- price contract type impracticable.\
(a) A ceiling price shall be negotiated for the contract at a level that reflects a reasonable sharing of risk by the contractor. The established ceiling price may be adjusted only if required by the operation of contract clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the contract price under stated circumstances.\
(b) The contract should be awarded only after negotiation of a billing price that is as fair and reasonable as the circumstances permit.\
(c) Since this contract type provides the contractor no cost control incentive except the ceiling price, the contracting officer should make clear to the contractor during discussion before award that the contractor\'92s management effectiveness and ingenuity will be considered in retroactively redetermining the price.\

\f0\b 16.206-3 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 This contract type shall not be used unless-\
(a) The contract is for research and development and the estimated cost is the simplified acquisition threshold or less; (b) The contractor\'92s accounting system is adequate for price redetermination;\
(c) There is reasonable assurance that the price redetermination will take place promptly at the specified time; and\
(d) The head of the contracting activity (or a higher-level official, if required by agency procedures) approves its use in\
writing.\

\f0\b 16.206-4 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-6\cf4 , Price Redetermination- Retroactive, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price contract is contemplated and the conditions in \cf3 16.206-2 \cf4 and \cf3 16.206-3\cf4 (a) through (d) apply.\

 16.207 Firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contracts.\
16.207-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 A firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contract requires-\
(a) The contractor to provide a specified level of effort, over a stated period of time, on work that can be stated only in general terms; and\
(b) The Government to pay the contractor a fixed dollar amount.\

\f0\b 16.207-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 A firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contract is suitable for investigation or study in a specific research and development area. The product of the contract is usually a report showing the results achieved through application of the required level of effort. However, payment is based on the effort expended rather than on the results achieved.\

\f0\b 16.207-3 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 This contract type may be used only when-\
(a) The work required cannot otherwise be clearly defined;\
(b) The required level of effort is identified and agreed upon in advance;\
(c) There is reasonable assurance that the intended result cannot be achieved by expending less than the stipulated effort;\
and\
(d) The contract price is the simplified acquisition threshold or less, unless approved by the chief of the contracting office.\

\fs24 Subpart 16.3 - Cost-Reimbursement Contracts\

\fs20 16.301 General.\
16.301-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 Cost-reimbursement types of contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer.\

\f0\b 16.301-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall use cost-reimbursement contracts only when-\
(1) Circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract\
(see \cf3 7.105\cf4 ); or\
(2) Uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use\
any type of fixed-price contract.\
(b) The contracting officer shall document the rationale for selecting the contract type in the written acquisition plan and\
ensure that the plan is approved and signed at least one level above the contracting officer (see \cf3 7.103\cf4 (j) and \cf3 7.105\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 16.301-3 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 (a) A cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when
\f2\i  \

\f1\i0 (1) The factors in \cf3 16.104 \cf4 have been considered;\
(2) A written acquisition plan has been approved and signed at least one level above the contracting officer;\
(3) The contractor\'92s accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract or order; and (4) Prior to award of the contract or order, adequate Government resources are available to award and manage a\
contract other than firm-fixed-priced (see \cf3 7.104\cf4 (e)). This includes appropriate Government surveillance during performance in accordance with \cf3 1.602-2\cf4 , to provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used.\
(b) The use of cost-reimbursement contracts is prohibited for the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services (see \cf3 parts 2 \cf4 and \cf3 12\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 16.302 Cost contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description. 
\f1\i0 A cost contract is a cost-reimbursement contract in which the contractor receives no fee.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A cost contract may be appropriate for research and development work, particularly with nonprofit educational institutions or other nonprofit organizations.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . See \cf3 16.301-3\cf4 .\

\f0\b 16.303 Cost-sharing contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description. 
\f1\i0 A cost-sharing contract is a cost-reimbursement contract in which the contractor receives no fee and is reimbursed only for an agreed-upon portion of its allowable costs.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A cost-sharing contract may be used when the contractor agrees to absorb a portion of the costs, in the expectation of substantial compensating benefits.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . See \cf3 16.301-3\cf4 .\

\f0\b 16.304 Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts.\

\f1\b0 A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts are covered in \cf3 subpart 16.4\cf4 , Incentive Contracts. See \cf3 16.405-1 \cf4 for a more complete description and discussion of application of these contracts. See \cf3 16.301-3 \cf4 for limitations.\

\f0\b 16.305 Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.\

\f1\b0 A cost-plus-award-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for a fee consisting of (a)a base amount (which may be zero) fixed at inception of the contract and (b)an award amount, based upon a judgmental evaluation by the Government, sufficient to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance. cost-plus-award-fee contracts are\

of these contracts. See \cf3 16.301-3 \cf4 and \cf3 16.401\cf4 (e)(5) for limitations.\

\f0\b 16.306 Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description. 
\f1\i0 A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract. The fixed fee does not vary with actual cost, but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. This contract type permits contracting for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but it provides the contractor only a minimum incentive to control costs.\
(b) Application. (1) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is suitable for use when the conditions of \cf3 16.301-2 \cf4 are present and, for example-\
(i) The contract is for the performance of research or preliminary exploration or study, and the level of effort required is unknown; or\
(ii) The contract is for development and test, and using a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is not practical.\
(2) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract normally should not be used in development of major systems (see \cf3 part 34\cf4 ) once\
preliminary exploration, studies, and risk reduction have indicated a high degree of probability that the development is achievable and the Government has established reasonably firm performance objectives and schedules.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . No cost-plus-fixed-fee contract shall be awarded unless the contracting officer complies with all limitations in \cf3 15.404-4\cf4 (c)(4)(i) and \cf3 16.301-3\cf4 .\
(d) 
\f2\i Completion and term forms
\f1\i0 . A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may take one of two basic forms-completion or term.\
(1) The completion form describes the scope of work by stating a definite goal or target and specifying an end product. This form of contract normally requires the contractor to complete and deliver the specified end product (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 a final report of\
research accomplishing the goal or target) within the estimated cost, if possible, as a condition for payment of the entire fixed fee. However, in the event the work cannot be completed within the estimated cost, the Government may require more effort without increase in fee, provided the Government increases the estimated cost.\
(2) The term form describes the scope of work in general terms and obligates the contractor to devote a specified level of effort for a stated time period. Under this form, if the performance is considered satisfactory by the Government, the fixed fee is payable at the expiration of the agreed-upon period, upon contractor statement that the level of effort specified in the contract has been expended in performing the contract work. Renewal for further periods of performance is a new acquisition that involves new cost and fee arrangements.\
(3) Because of the differences in obligation assumed by the contractor, the completion form is preferred over the term form whenever the work, or specific milestones for the work, can be defined well enough to permit development of estimates within which the contractor can be expected to complete the work.\
(4) The term form shall not be used unless the contractor is obligated by the contract to provide a specific level of effort within a definite time period.\

\f0\b 16.307 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-7\cf4 , Allowable Cost and Payment, in solicitations and contracts when a cost-reimbursement contract or a time-and-materials contract (other than a contract for a commercial product or commercial service) is contemplated. If the contract is a time-and-materials contract, the clause at \cf3 52.216-7 \cf4 applies in conjunction with the clause at \cf3 52.232-7\cf4 ), but only to the portion of the contract that provides for reimbursement of materials (as defined in the clause at \cf3 52.232-7\cf4 ) at actual cost. Further, the clause at \cf3 52.216-7 \cf4 does not apply to labor-hour contracts.\
(2) If the contract is a construction contract and contains the clause at \cf3 52.232-27\cf4 , Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts, the contracting officer shall use the clause at \cf3 52.216-7 \cf4 with its Alternate I.\
(3) If the contract is with an educational institution, the contracting officer shall use the clause at \cf3 52.216-7 \cf4 with its Alternate II.\
(4) If the contract is with a State or local government, the contracting officer shall use the clause at \cf3 52.216-7 \cf4 with its Alternate III.\
(5) If the contract is with a nonprofit organization other than an educational institution, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization exempted under the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, appendix VIII, the contracting officer shall use the clause at \cf3 52.216-7 \cf4 with its Alternate IV.\

 16.401 General.\

\fs24 Subpart 16.4 - Incentive Contracts\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) Incentive contracts as described in this subpart are appropriate when a firm-fixed-price contract is not appropriate and the required supplies or services can be acquired at lower costs and, in certain instances, with improved delivery or technical performance, by relating the amount of profit or fee payable under the contract to the contractor\'92s performance. Incentive contracts are designed to obtain specific acquisition objectives by-\
(1) Establishing reasonable and attainable targets that are clearly communicated to the contractor; and (2) Including appropriate incentive arrangements designed to-\
(i) motivate contractor efforts that might not otherwise be emphasized; and\
(ii) discourage contractor inefficiency and waste.\
(b) When predetermined, formula-type incentives on technical performance or delivery are included, increases in profit\
or fee are provided only for achievement that surpasses the targets, and decreases are provided for to the extent that such targets are not met. The incentive increases or decreases are applied to performance targets rather than minimum performance requirements.\
(c) The two basic categories of incentive contracts are fixed-price incentive contracts (see \cf3 16.403 \cf4 and \cf3 16.404\cf4 ) and cost- reimbursement incentive contracts (see \cf3 16.405\cf4 ). Since it is usually to the Government\'92s advantage for the contractor to assume substantial cost responsibility and an appropriate share of the cost risk, fixed-price incentive contracts are preferred when contract costs and performance requirements are reasonably certain. Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts are subject to the overall limitations in \cf3 16.301 \cf4 that apply to all cost-reimbursement contracts.\
(d) A determination and finding, signed by the head of the contracting activity, shall be completed for all incentive- and award-fee contracts justifying that the use of this type of contract is in the best interest of the Government. This determination shall be documented in the contract file and, for award-fee contracts, shall address all of the suitability items in \cf3 16.401\cf4 (e)(1).\
(e) Award-fee contracts are a type of incentive contract.\
(1) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . An award-fee contract is suitable for use when-\
(i) The work to be performed is such that it is neither feasible nor effective to devise predetermined objective incentive targets applicable to cost, schedule, and technical performance;\
(ii) The likelihood of meeting acquisition objectives will be enhanced by using a contract that effectively motivates the contractor toward exceptional performance and provides the Government with the flexibility to evaluate both actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved; and\
(iii) Any additional administrative effort and cost required to monitor and evaluate performance are justified by the expected benefits as documented by a risk and cost benefit analysis to be included in the Determination and Findings referenced in \cf3 16.401\cf4 (e)(5)(iii).\
(2) 
\f2\i Award-fee amount
\f1\i0 . The amount of award fee earned shall be commensurate with the contractor\'92s overall cost, schedule, and technical performance as measured against contract requirements in accordance with the criteria stated in\
the award-fee plan. Award fee shall not be earned if the contractor\'92s overall cost, schedule, and technical performance in\
the aggregate is below satisfactory. The basis for all award-fee determinations shall be documented in the contract file to include, at a minimum, a determination that overall cost, schedule and technical performance in the aggregate is or is not at a satisfactory level. This determination and the methodology for determining the award fee are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government.\
(3) 
\f2\i Award-fee plan
\f1\i0 . All contracts providing for award fees shall be supported by an award-fee plan that establishes the procedures for evaluating award fee and an Award-Fee Board for conducting the award-fee evaluation. Award-fee plans shall-\
(i) Be approved by the FDO unless otherwise authorized by agency procedures;\
(ii) Identify the award-fee evaluation criteria and how they are linked to acquisition objectives which shall be defined in terms of contract cost, schedule, and technical performance. Criteria should motivate the contractor to enhance performance in the areas rated, but not at the expense of at least minimum acceptable performance in all other areas;\
(iii) Describe how the contractor\'92s performance will be measured against the award-fee evaluation criteria;\
(iv) Utilize the adjectival rating and associated description as well as the award-fee pool earned percentages shown below in Table 16-1. Contracting officers may supplement the adjectival rating description. The method used to determine the adjectival rating must be documented in the award-fee plan;\

\cf3 16.401\cf4 (e)(1).\
(f) 
\f2\i Incentive- and Award-Fee Data Collection and Analysis
\f1\i0 . Each agency shall collect relevant data on award fee and\
incentive fees paid to contractors and include performance measures to evaluate such data on a regular basis to determine effectiveness of award and incentive fees as a tool for improving contractor performance and achieving desired program outcomes. This information should be considered as part of the acquisition planning process (see \cf3 7.105\cf4 ) in determining the appropriate type of contract to be utilized for future acquisitions.\
(g) 
\f2\i Incentive- and Award-Fee Best Practices
\f1\i0 . Each agency head shall provide mechanisms for sharing proven incentive strategies for the acquisition of different types of products and services among contracting and program management officials.\

\f0\b 16.402 Application of predetermined, formula-type incentives.\
16.402-1 Cost incentives.\

\f1\b0 (a) Most incentive contracts include only cost incentives, which take the form of a profit or fee adjustment formula and are intended to motivate the contractor to effectively manage costs. No incentive contract may provide for other incentives without also providing a cost incentive (or constraint).\

\f1\b0 (b) Except for award-fee contracts (see \cf3 16.404 \cf4 and \cf3 16.401\cf4 (e)), incentive contracts include a target cost, a target profit or fee, and a profit or fee adjustment formula that (within the constraints of a price ceiling or minimum and maximum fee) provides that-\
(1) Actual cost that meets the target will result in the target profit or fee;\
(2) Actual cost that exceeds the target will result in downward adjustment of target profit or fee; and (3) Actual cost that is below the target will result in upward adjustment of target profit or fee.\

\f0\b 16.402-2 Performance incentives.\

\f1\b0 (a) Performance incentives may be considered in connection with specific product characteristics (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 a missile range, an aircraft speed, an engine thrust, or a vehicle maneuverability) or other specific elements of the contractor\'92s performance. These incentives should be designed to relate profit or fee to results achieved by the contractor, compared with specified targets.\
(b) To the maximum extent practicable, positive and negative performance incentives shall be considered in connection with service contracts for performance of objectively measurable tasks when quality of performance is critical and incentives are likely to motivate the contractor.\
(c) Technical performance incentives may be particularly appropriate in major systems contracts, both in development (when performance objectives are known and the fabrication of prototypes for test and evaluation is required) and in production (if improved performance is attainable and highly desirable to the Government).\
(d) Technical performance incentives may involve a variety of specific characteristics that contribute to the overall performance of the end item. Accordingly, the incentives on individual technical characteristics must be balanced so that no one of them is exaggerated to the detriment of the overall performance of the end item.\
(e) Performance tests and/or assessments of work performance are generally essential in order to determine the degree of attainment of performance targets. Therefore, the contract must be as specific as possible in establishing test criteria (such as testing conditions, instrumentation precision, and data interpretation) and performance standards (such as the quality levels of services to be provided).\
(f) Because performance incentives present complex problems in contract administration, the contracting officer should negotiate them in full coordination with Government engineering and pricing specialists.\
(g) It is essential that the Government and contractor agree explicitly on the effect that contract changes (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 pursuant to the Changes clause) will have on performance incentives.\
(h) The contracting officer must exercise care, in establishing performance criteria, to recognize that the contractor should not be rewarded or penalized for attainments of Government-furnished components.\

\f0\b 16.402-3 Delivery incentives.\

\f1\b0 (a) Delivery incentives should be considered when improvement from a required delivery schedule is a significant Government objective. It is important to determine the Government\'92s primary objectives in a given contract (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 earliest possible delivery or earliest quantity production).\
(b) Incentive arrangements on delivery should specify the application of the reward-penalty structure in the event of Government-caused delays or other delays beyond the control, and without the fault or negligence, of the contractor or subcontractor.\

\f0\b 16.402-4 Structuring multiple-incentive contracts.\

\f1\b0 A properly structured multiple-incentive arrangement should-\
(a) Motivate the contractor to strive for outstanding results in all incentive areas; and\
(b) Compel trade-off decisions among the incentive areas, consistent with the Government\'92s overall objectives for the\
acquisition. Because of the interdependency of the Government\'92s cost, the technical performance, and the delivery goals,\
a contract that emphasizes only one of the goals may jeopardize control over the others. Because outstanding results may not be attainable for each of the incentive areas, all multiple-incentive contracts must include a cost incentive (or constraint) that operates to preclude rewarding a contractor for superior technical performance or delivery results when the cost of those results outweighs their value to the Government.\

\f0\b 16.403 Fixed-price incentive contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A fixed-price incentive contract is a fixed-price contract that provides for adjusting profit and establishing the final contract price by application of a formula based on the relationship of total final negotiated cost to total target cost.\

\fs20 The final price is subject to a price ceiling, negotiated at the outset. The two forms of fixed-price incentive contracts, firm target and successive targets, are further described in \cf3 16.403-1 \cf4 and \cf3 16.403-2 \cf4 below.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A fixed-price incentive contract is appropriate when-\
(1) A firm-fixed-price contract is not suitable;\
(2) The nature of the supplies or services being acquired and other circumstances of the acquisition are such that the\
contractor\'92s assumption of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive profit incentive for effective cost control and performance; and\
(3) If the contract also includes incentives on technical performance and/or delivery, the performance requirements provide a reasonable opportunity for the incentives to have a meaningful impact on the contractor\'92s management of the work.\
(c) 
\f2\i Billing prices
\f1\i0 . In fixed-price incentive contracts, billing prices are established as an interim basis for payment. These billing prices may be adjusted, within the ceiling limits, upon request of either party to the contract, when it becomes apparent that final negotiated cost will be substantially different from the target cost.\

\f0\b 16.403-1 Fixed-price incentive (firm target) contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract specifies a target cost, a target profit, a price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor), and a profit adjustment formula. These elements are all negotiated at the outset. The price ceiling is the maximum that may be paid to the contractor, except for any adjustment under other contract clauses. When the contractor completes performance, the parties negotiate the final cost, and the final price is established by applying the formula. When the final cost is less than the target cost, application of the formula results in a final profit greater than the target profit; conversely, when final cost is more than target cost, application of the formula results in a final profit less than the target profit, or even a net loss. If the final negotiated cost exceeds the price ceiling, the contractor absorbs the difference as a loss. Because the profit varies inversely with the cost, this contract type provides a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract is appropriate when the parties can negotiate at the outset a firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula that will provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk. When the contractor assumes a considerable or major share of the cost responsibility under the adjustment formula, the target profit should reflect this responsibility.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . This contract type may be used only when-\
(1) The contractor\'92s accounting system is adequate for providing data to support negotiation of final cost and incentive\
price revision; and\
(2) Adequate cost or pricing information for establishing reasonable firm targets is available at the time of initial\
contract negotiation.\
(d) 
\f2\i Contract schedule
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall specify in the contract schedule the target cost, target profit, and target\
price for each item subject to incentive price revision.\

\f0\b 16.403-2 Fixed-price incentive (successive targets) contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) Description. (1) A fixed-price incentive (successive targets) contract specifies the following elements, all of which are negotiated at the outset:\
(i) An initial target cost.\
(ii) An initial target profit.\
(iii) An initial profit adjustment formula to be used for establishing the firm target profit, including a ceiling and\
floor for the firm target profit. (This formula normally provides for a lesser degree of contractor cost responsibility than would a formula for establishing final profit and price.)\
(iv) The production point at which the firm target cost and firm target profit will be negotiated (usually before delivery or shop completion of the first item).\
(v) A ceiling price that is the maximum that may be paid to the contractor, except for any adjustment under other contract clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the contract price under stated circumstances.\
(2) When the production point specified in the contract is reached, the parties negotiate the firm target cost, giving consideration to cost experience under the contract and other pertinent factors. The firm target profit is established by the formula. At this point, the parties have two alternatives, as follows:\
(i) They may negotiate a firm fixed price, using the firm target cost plus the firm target profit as a guide.\

\fs16 ONTRACTS 
\f0\b\fs20 16.405-1\
 
\f1\b0 (ii) If negotiation of a firm fixed price is inappropriate, they may negotiate a formula for establishing the final price using the firm target cost and firm target profit. The final cost is then negotiated at completion, and the final profit is established by formula, as under the fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract (see \cf3 16.403-1 \cf4 above).\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A fixed-price incentive (successive targets) contract is appropriate when-\
(1) Available cost or pricing information is not sufficient to permit the negotiation of a realistic firm target cost and\
profit before award;\
(2) Sufficient information is available to permit negotiation of initial targets; and\
(3) There is reasonable assurance that additional reliable information will be available at an early point in the contract\
performance so as to permit negotiation of either (i)a firm fixed price or (ii) firm targets and a formula for establishing final profit and price that will provide a fair and reasonable incentive. This additional information is not limited to experience under the contract, itself, but may be drawn from other contracts for the same or similar items.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . This contract type may be used only when-\
(1) The contractor\'92s accounting system is adequate for providing data for negotiating firm targets and a realistic profit\
adjustment formula, as well as later negotiation of final costs; and\
(2) Cost or pricing information adequate for establishing a reasonable firm target cost is reasonably expected to be\
available at an early point in contract performance.\
(d) 
\f2\i Contract schedule
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall specify in the contract schedule the initial target cost, initial target\
profit, and initial target price for each item subject to incentive price revision.\

\f0\b 16.404 Fixed-price contracts with award fees.\

\f1\b0 Award-fee provisions may be used in fixed-price contracts when the Government wishes to motivate a contractor and other incentives cannot be used because contractor performance cannot be measured objectively. Such contracts shall establish a fixed price (including normal profit) for the effort. This price will be paid for satisfactory contract performance. Award fee earned (if any) will be paid in addition to that fixed price. See \cf3 16.401\cf4 (e) for the requirements relative to utilizing this contract type.\

\f0\b 16.405 Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts.\

\f1\b0 See \cf3 16.301 \cf4 for requirements applicable to all cost-reimbursement contracts, for use in conjunction with the following subsections.\

\f0\b 16.405-1 Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for the initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. This contract type specifies a target cost, a target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee adjustment formula. After contract performance, the fee payable to the contractor is determined in accordance with the formula. The formula provides, within limits, for increases in fee above target fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee below target fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the contractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is greater than or less than the range of costs within which the fee-adjustment formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.\
(b) Application. (1) A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is appropriate for services or development and test programs when- (i) A cost-reimbursement contract is necessary (see \cf3 16.301-2\cf4 ); and\
(ii) A target cost and a fee adjustment formula can be negotiated that are likely to motivate the contractor to manage\
effectively.\
(2) The contract may include technical performance incentives when it is highly probable that the required development\
of a major system is feasible and the Government has established its performance objectives, at least in general terms. This approach also may apply to other acquisitions, if the use of both cost and technical performance incentives is desirable and administratively practical.\
(3) The fee adjustment formula should provide an incentive that will be effective over the full range of reasonably foreseeable variations from target cost. If a high maximum fee is negotiated, the contract shall also provide for a low minimum fee that may be a zero fee or, in rare cases, a negative fee.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . No cost-plus-incentive-fee contract shall be awarded unless all limitations in \cf3 16.301-3 \cf4 are complied with.\

\f0\b\fs20 16.405-2 Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.\

\f1\b0 A cost-plus-award-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for a fee consisting of (1) a base amount fixed at inception of the contract, if applicable and at the discretion of the contracting officer, and (2) an award amount that the contractor may earn in whole or in part during performance and that is sufficient to provide motivation for excellence in the areas of cost, schedule, and technical performance. See \cf3 16.401\cf4 (e) for the requirements relative to utilizing this contract type.\

\f0\b 16.406 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-16\cf4 , Incentive Price Revision-Firm Target, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-\
price incentive (firm target) contract is contemplated. If the contract calls for supplies or services to be ordered under a provisioning document or Government option and the prices are to be subject to the incentive price revision under the clause, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.\
(b) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-17\cf4 , Incentive Price Revision-Successive Targets, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed- price incentive (successive targets) contract is contemplated. If the contract calls for supplies or services to be ordered under a provisioning document or Government option and the prices are to be subject to incentive price revision under the clause, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.\
(c) The clause at \cf3 52.216-7\cf4 , Allowable Cost and Payment, is prescribed in \cf3 16.307\cf4 (a) for insertion in solicitations and contracts when a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract or a cost-plus-award-fee contract is contemplated.\
(d) The clause at \cf3 52.216-10\cf4 , Incentive Fee, is prescribed in \cf3 16.307\cf4 (d) for insertion in solicitations and contracts when a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is contemplated.\
(e) Insert an appropriate award-fee clause in solicitations and contracts when an award-fee contract is contemplated, provided that the clause-\
(1) Is prescribed by or approved under agency acquisition regulations;\
(2) Is compatible with the clause at \cf3 52.216-7\cf4 , Allowable Cost and Payment; and\
(3) Expressly provides that the award amount and the award-fee determination methodology are unilateral decisions\
made solely at the discretion of the Government.\

\fs24 Subpart 16.5 - Indefinite-Delivery Contracts\

\fs20 16.500 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for making awards of indefinite-delivery contracts and establishes a preference for making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts.\
(b) This subpart does not limit the use of other than competitive procedures authorized by \cf3 part 6\cf4 .\
(c) Nothing in this subpart restricts the authority of the General Services Administration (GSA) to enter into schedule, multiple award, or task or delivery order contracts under any other provision of law. Therefore, GSA regulations and the coverage for the Federal Supply Schedule program in \cf3 subpart 8.4 \cf4 and \cf3 part 38 \cf4 take precedence over this subpart.\
(d) The statutory multiple award preference implemented by this subpart does not apply to architect-engineer contracts subject to the procedures in \cf3 subpart 36.6\cf4 . However, agencies are not precluded from making multiple awards for architect- engineer services using the procedures in this subpart, provided the selection of contractors and placement of orders are consistent with \cf3 subpart 36.6\cf4 .\
(e) See \cf3 subpart 19.5 \cf4 for procedures to set aside part or parts of multiple-award contracts for small businesses; to reserve one or more awards for small business on multiple-award contracts; and to set aside orders for small businesses under multiple-award contracts.\

\f0\b 16.501 [Reserved]\
16.501-1 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Delivery-order contract 
\f1\i0 means a contract for supplies that does not procure or specify a firm quantity of supplies (other than a minimum or maximum quantity) and that provides for the issuance of orders for the delivery of supplies during the period of the contract.\

\f2\i Task-order contract 
\f1\i0 means a contract for services that does not procure or specify a firm quantity of services (other than a minimum or maximum quantity) and that provides for the issuance of orders for the performance of tasks during the period of the contract.\

\f0\b 16.501-2 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) There are three types of indefinite-delivery contracts: definite-quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and indefinite-quantity contracts. The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract may be used to acquire supplies and/\
or services when the exact times and/or exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of contract award. Pursuant to \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3401 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 4101\cf4 , requirements contracts and indefinite-quantity contracts are also known as delivery-order contracts or task-order contracts.\
(b) The various types of indefinite-delivery contracts offer the following advantages: (1) All three types permit-\
(i) Government stocks to be maintained at minimum levels; and\
(ii) Direct shipment to users.\
(2) Indefinite-quantity contracts and requirements contracts also permit-\
(i) Flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling; and\
(ii) Ordering of supplies or services after requirements materialize.\
(3) Indefinite-quantity contracts limit the Government\'92s obligation to the minimum quantity specified in the contract. (4) Requirements contracts may permit faster deliveries when production lead time is involved, because contractors are\
usually willing to maintain limited stocks when the Government will obtain all of its actual purchase requirements from the contractor.\
(c) Indefinite-delivery contracts may provide for any appropriate cost or pricing arrangement under \cf3 part 16\cf4 . Cost or pricing arrangements that provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 estimated number of labor hours) must comply with the appropriate procedures of this subpart.\

\f0\b 16.502 Definite-quantity contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A definite-quantity contract provides for delivery of a definite quantity of specific supplies or services for a fixed period, with deliveries or performance to be scheduled at designated locations upon order.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A definite-quantity contract may be used when it can be determined in advance that-\

\fs20 (1) A definite quantity of supplies or services will be required during the contract period; and\
(2) The supplies or services are regularly available or will be available after a short lead time.\

\f0\b 16.503 Requirements contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A requirements contract provides for filling all actual purchase requirements of designated Government activities for supplies or services during a specified contract period (from one contractor), with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by placing orders with the contractor.\
(1) For the information of offerors and contractors, the contracting officer shall state a realistic estimated total quantity in the solicitation and resulting contract. This estimate is not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal. The contracting officer may obtain the estimate from records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means, and should base the estimate on the most current information available.\
(2) The contract shall state, if feasible, the maximum limit of the contractor\'92s obligation to deliver and the Government\'92s obligation to order. The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the Government may order under each individual order and the maximum that it may order during a specified period of time.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . (1) A requirements contract may be appropriate for acquiring any supplies or services when the Government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities of supplies or services that designated Government activities will need during a definite period.\
(2) No requirements contract in an amount estimated to exceed $100 million (including all options) may be awarded to a single source unless a determination is executed in accordance with \cf3 16.504\cf4 (c)(1)(ii)(D).\
(c) 
\f2\i Government property furnished for repair
\f1\i0 . When a requirements contract is used to acquire work (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 repair, modification, or overhaul) on existing items of Government property, the contracting officer shall specify in the Schedule that failure of the Government to furnish such items in the amounts or quantities described in the Schedule as "estimated" or "maximum" will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price under the Government Property clause of the contract.\
(d) Limitations on use of requirements contracts for advisory and assistance services. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no solicitation for a requirements contract for advisory and assistance services in excess of three years and $15 million (including all options) may be issued unless the contracting officer or other official designated by the head of the agency determines in writing that the services required are so unique or highly specialized that it is not practicable to make multiple awards using the procedures in \cf3 16.504\cf4 .\
(2) The limitation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not applicable to an acquisition of supplies or services that includes the acquisition of advisory and assistance services, if the contracting officer or other official designated by the head of the agency determines that the advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.\

\f0\b 16.504 Indefinite-quantity contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.\
(1) The contract must require the Government to order and the contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services. In addition, if ordered, the contractor must furnish any additional quantities, not to exceed the stated maximum. The contracting officer should establish a reasonable maximum quantity based on market research, trends on recent contracts for similar supplies or services, survey of potential users, or any other rational basis.\
(2) To ensure that the contract is binding, the minimum quantity must be more than a nominal quantity, but it should not exceed the amount that the Government is fairly certain to order.\
(3) The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the Government may order under each task or delivery order and the maximum that it may order during a specific period of time.\
(4) A solicitation and contract for an indefinite quantity must-\
(i) Specify the period of the contract, including the number of options and the period for which the Government may\
extend the contract under each option;\
(ii) Specify the total minimum and maximum quantity of supplies or services the Government will acquire under the\
contract;\

\f1\b0 (iii) Include a statement of work, specifications, or other description, that reasonably describes the general scope, nature, complexity, and purpose of the supplies or services the Government will acquire under the contract in a manner that will enable a prospective offeror to decide whether to submit an offer;\
(iv) State the procedures that the Government will use in issuing orders, including the ordering media, and, if multiple awards may be made, state the procedures and selection criteria that the Government will use to provide awardees a fair opportunity to be considered for each order (see \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(1));\
(v) Include a description of the activities authorized to issue orders; and\
(vi) Include authorization for placing oral orders, if appropriate, provided that the Government has established procedures for obligating funds and that oral orders are confirmed in writing.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . Contracting officers may use an indefinite-quantity contract when the Government cannot predetermine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the Government will require during the contract period, and it is inadvisable for the Government to commit itself for more than a minimum quantity. The contracting officer should use an indefinite-quantity contract only when a recurring need is anticipated.\
(c) Multiple award preference- (1) Planning the acquisition. (i) Except for indefinite-quantity contracts for advisory\
and assistance services as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the contracting officer must, to the maximum extent practicable, give preference to making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts under a single solicitation for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources.\
(ii) (A) The contracting officer must determine whether multiple awards are appropriate as part of acquisition planning. The contracting officer must avoid situations in which awardees specialize exclusively in one or a few areas within the statement of work, thus creating the likelihood that orders in those areas will be awarded on a sole-source basis; however, each awardee need not be capable of performing every requirement as well as any other awardee under the contracts. The contracting officer should consider the following when determining the number of contracts to be awarded:\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 The scope and complexity of the contract requirement.\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 The expected duration and frequency of task or delivery orders.\

\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 The mix of resources a contractor must have to perform expected task or delivery order requirements.\

\f2\i (4) 
\f1\i0 The ability to maintain competition among the awardees throughout the contracts\'92 period of performance.\
(B) The contracting officer must not use the multiple award approach if-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Only one contractor is capable of providing performance at the level of quality required because the\
supplies or services are unique or highly specialized;\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Based on the contracting officer\'92s knowledge of the market, more favorable terms and conditions,\
including pricing, will be provided if a single award is made;\

\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 The expected cost of administration of multiple contracts outweighs the expected benefits of making\
multiple awards;\

\f2\i (4) 
\f1\i0 The projected task orders are so integrally related that only a single contractor can reasonably perform the\
work;\
Government; or circumstances.\

\f2\i (ii) 
\f1\i0 The contract provides only for firm-fixed price (see \cf3 16.202\cf4 ) task or delivery orders for-\

\f2\i (A) 
\f1\i0 Products for which unit prices are established in the contract; or\

\f2\i (B)

\f0\b 16.505 Ordering.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . (1) In general, the contracting officer does not synopsize orders under indefinite-delivery contracts; except see \cf3 16.505\cf4 (a)(4) and (11), and \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(2)(ii)(D).\
(2) Individual orders shall clearly describe all services to be performed or supplies to be delivered so the full cost or price for the performance of the work can be established when the order is placed. Orders shall be within the scope, issued within the period of performance, and be within the maximum value of the contract.\
(3) Performance-based acquisition methods must be used to the maximum extent practicable, if the contract or order is for services (see \cf3 37.102\cf4 (a) and subpart \cf3 37.6\cf4 ).\
(4) The following requirements apply when procuring items peculiar to one manufacturer:\
(i) The contracting officer must justify restricting consideration to an item peculiar to one manufacturer (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , a\
particular brand-name, product, or a feature of a product that is peculiar to one manufacturer). A brand-name item, even if available on more than one contract, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. Brand-name specifications shall not be used unless the particular brand-name, product, or feature is essential to the Government\'92s requirements and market research indicates other companies\'92 similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency\'92s needs.\
(ii) Requirements for use of items peculiar to one manufacturer shall be justified and approved using the format(s) and requirements from paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section, modified to show the brand-name justification. A justification is required unless a justification covering the requirements in the order was previously approved for the contract in accordance with \cf3 6.302-1\cf4 (c) or unless the base contract is a single-award contract awarded under full and open competition. Justifications for the use of brand-name specifications must be completed and approved at the time the requirement for a brand-name is determined.\
(iii) (A) For an order in excess of $30,000, the contracting officer shall\'97\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Post the justification and supporting documentation on the agency website used (if any) to solicit offers for\
orders under the contract; or\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Provide the justification and supporting documentation along with the solicitation to all contract awardees.\
(B) The justifications for brand-name acquisitions may apply to the portion of the acquisition requiring the brand- name item. If the justification is to cover only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name, then it should so state; the approval level requirements will then only apply to that portion.\
(C) The requirements in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section do not apply when disclosure would compromise the national security (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , would result in disclosure of classified information) or create other security risks.\
(D) The justification is subject to the screening requirement in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
\f2\i 4
\f1\i0 ) of this section.\
(5) When acquiring information technology and related services, consider the use of modular contracting to reduce\
program risk (see \cf3 39.103\cf4 (a)).\
(6) Orders may be placed by using any medium specified in the contract.\
(7) Orders placed under indefinite-delivery contracts must contain the following information:\

(iii) For protests of small business size status for set-aside orders, see 19.302.\
(11) Publicize orders funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) as follows:\

(ii) Award notices for orders shall follow the procedures in \cf3 5.705\cf4 .\
(12) When using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment, orders at or below the\

(b) 
\f2\i Orders under multiple-award contracts\'97\

\f1\i0 (1) 
\f2\i Fair opportunity
\f1\i0 . (i) The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each\

(A) As provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or\
(B) Orders issued under \cf3 19.504\cf4 (c)(1)(ii).\
(ii) The contracting officer may exercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures.\
The contracting officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum. Contracting officers may use streamlined procedures, including oral presentations. If the order does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer need not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee if the contracting officer has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order.\

\fs20 The competition requirements in part 6 and the policies in subpart \cf3 15.3 \cf4 do not apply to the ordering process. However, the contracting officer shall\'97\
(A) Develop placement procedures that will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order and that reflect the requirement and other aspects of the contracting environment;\
(B) Not use any method (such as allocation or designation of any preferred awardee) that would not result in fair consideration being given to all awardees prior to placing each order;\
(C) Tailor the procedures to each acquisition;\
(D) Include the procedures in the solicitation and the contract;\
(E) Consider price or cost under each order as one of the factors in the selection decision;\
(F) Except for DoD, ensure the criteria at \cf3 15.101-2\cf4 (c)(1)-(5) are met when using the lowest price technically\
acceptable source selection process; and\
(G) Except for DoD, avoid using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire\
certain supplies and services in accordance with \cf3 15.101-2\cf4 (d).\
(iii) Orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. (A) Each order exceeding the simplified acquisition\
threshold shall be placed on a competitive basis in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, unless supported by a written determination that one of the circumstances described at \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(2)(i) applies to the order and the requirement is waived on the basis of a justification that is prepared in accordance with \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(2)(ii)(B);\
(B) The contracting officer shall\'97\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Provide a fair notice of the intent to make a purchase, including a clear description of the supplies to be\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Afford all contractors responding to the notice a fair opportunity to submit an offer and have that offer fairly considered.\
(iv) 
\f2\i Orders exceeding $6 million
\f1\i0 . For task or delivery orders in excess of $6 million, the requirement to provide all awardees a fair opportunity to be considered for each order shall include, at a minimum\'97\
(A) A notice of the task or delivery order that includes a clear statement of the agency\'92s requirements; (B) A reasonable response period;\
(C) Disclosure of the significant factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that the agency expects to\
consider in evaluating proposals, and their relative importance;\

relative importance of quality and price or cost factors; and\
(E) An opportunity for a postaward debriefing in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section.\
(v) The contracting officer should consider the following when developing the procedures:\
(A) 
\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control.\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor.\

\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 Minimum order requirements.\

exchanges of information, such as\'97\

\f2\i (i) 
\f1\i0 Seeking comments from two or more contractors on draft statements of work;\

\f1\i0 Using a multiphased approach when effort required to respond to a potential order may be resource\
intensive (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 requirements are complex or need continued development), where all contractors are initially considered on price considerations (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 rough estimates), and other considerations as appropriate (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 proposed conceptual approach, past performance). The contractors most likely to submit the highest value solutions are then selected for one-on-one sessions with the Government to increase their understanding of the requirements, provide suggestions for refining requirements, and discuss risk reduction measures.\
(B) Formal evaluation plans or scoring of quotes or offers are not required.\
(2) 
\f2\i Exceptions to the fair opportunity process
\f1\i0 . (i) The contracting officer shall give every awardee a fair opportunity to\
be considered for a delivery order or task order exceeding the micro-purchase threshold unless one of the following statutory exceptions applies:\

(D) It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.\
(E) For orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a specified source.\
(F) In accordance with section 1331 of Public Law 111-240 (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 644\cf4 (r)), contracting officers may, at their discretion, set aside orders for any of the small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3). When setting aside orders for small business concerns, the specific small business program eligibility requirements identified in \cf3 part 19 \cf4 apply.\
(G) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the order satisfies one of the exceptions permitting the use of other than full and open competition listed in \cf3 6.302 \cf4 (\cf3 10 U.S.C. 3406(c)(5)\cf4 ).

(1) Except as provided for in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, the ordering period of a task-order contract for advisory and assistance services, including all options or modifications, normally may not exceed 5 years.\
(2) The 5-year limitation does not apply when\'97\
(i) A longer ordering period is specifically authorized by a statute; or\
(ii) The contract is for an acquisition of supplies or services that includes the acquisition of advisory and assistance\
services and the contracting officer, or other official designated by the head of the agency, determines that the advisory and assistance services are incidental and not a significant component of the contract.\
(3) The contracting officer may extend the contract on a sole-source basis only once for a period not to exceed 6 months if the contracting officer, or other official designated by the head of the agency, determines that\'97\
(i) The award of a follow-on contract is delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and\
(ii) The extension is necessary to ensure continuity of services, pending the award of the follow-on contract.\

\fs24 Subpart 16.6 - Time-and-Materials, Labor-Hour, and Letter Contracts\

\f1\b0\fs20 Time-and-materials contracts and labor-hour contracts are not fixed-price contracts.\

\f0\b 16.601 Time-and-materials contracts.\

\f1\i0 means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are-\
(1) Performed by the contractor;\
(2) Performed by the subcontractors; or\
(3) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control.\

\f2\i Materials 
\f1\i0 means-\
(1) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a\
common control;\
(2) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (3) Other direct costs (
\f2\i e.g.

computer usage charges, etc.); and (4) Applicable indirect costs.\
(b) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A time-and-materials contract provides for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of-\
(1) Direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses,\
and profit; and\
(2) Actual cost for materials (except as provided for in \cf3 31.205-26\cf4 (e) and (f)).\
(c) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A time-and-materials contract may be used only when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. See \cf3 12.207\cf4 (b) for the use of time-and-material contracts for certain commercial services.\
(1) 
\f2\i Government surveillance
\f1\i0 . A time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, appropriate Government surveillance of contractor performance is required to give reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are being used.\
(2) 
\f2\i Fixed hourly rates
\f1\i0 . (i) The contract shall specify separate fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit for each category of labor (see \cf3 16.601\cf4 (f)(1)).\
(ii) For acquisitions of other than commercial products or commercial services awarded without adequate price competition (see \cf3 15.403-1\cf4 (c)(1)), the contract shall specify separate fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit for each category of labor to be performed by-\
(A) The contractor;\
(B) Each subcontractor; and\
(C) Each division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor under a common control.\
(iii) For contract actions that are not awarded using competitive procedures, unless exempt under paragraph (c)(2) (iv) of this section, the fixed hourly rates for services transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control-\
(A) Shall not include profit for the transferring organization; but\
(B) May include profit for the prime contractor.\
(iv) For contract actions that are not awarded using competitive procedures, the fixed hourly rates for services that\
meet the definition of \'93commercial service\'94 that are transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control may be the established catalog or market rate when-\
(A) It is the established practice of the transferring organization to price interorganizational transfers at other than cost for commercial work of the contractor or any division, subsidiary or affiliate of the contractor under a common control; and\
(B) The contracting officer has not determined the price to be unreasonable.\

(d) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . A time-and-materials contract or order may be used only if-\
(1) The contracting officer prepares a determination and findings that no other contract type is suitable. The\
determination and finding shall be-\
(i) Signed by the contracting officer prior to the execution of the base period or any option periods of the contracts;\
and\
(ii) Approved by the head of the contracting activity prior to the execution of the base period when the base period\
plus any option periods exceeds three years; and\
(2) The contract or order includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Also see \cf3 12.207 \cf4 (b)\
for further limitations on use of time-and-materials or labor-hour contracts for acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.\
(e) Post award requirements. Prior to an increase in the ceiling price of a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract or order, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Conduct an analysis of pricing and other relevant factors to determine if the action is in the best interest of the Government;\
(2) Document the decision in the contract or order file; and (3) When making a change that modifies the general scope of-\
(i) A contract, follow the procedures at \cf3 6.303\cf4 ;\
(ii) An order issued under the Federal Supply Schedules, follow the procedures at \cf3 8.405-6\cf4 ; or\
(iii) An order issued under multiple award task and delivery order contracts, follow the procedures at \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(2).\
(f) 
\f2\i Solicitation provisions
\f1\i0 . (1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.216-29\cf4 , Time-and-Materials/Labor- Hour Proposal Requirements\'97Other Than Commercial Acquisition With Adequate Price Competition, in solicitations contemplating use of a time-and-materials or labor-hour type of contract for the acquisition of other than commercial products or commercial services, if the price is expected to be based on adequate price competition.

(2) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.216-30\cf4 , Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements\'97Other Than Commercial Acquisition Without Adequate Price Competition, in solicitations for the acquisition of other than commercial products or commercial services contemplating use of a time-and-materials or labor-hour type of contract if the price is not expected to be based on adequate price competition.\
(3) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.216-31\cf4 , Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements\'97Commercial Acquisition, in solicitations contemplating use of a commercial time-and-materials or labor-hour contract.\

\f0\b 16.602 Labor-hour contracts.\

\f2\i\b0 Description. 
\f1\i0 A labor-hour contract is a variation of the time-and-materials contract, differing only in that materials are not supplied by the contractor. See \cf3 12.207\cf4 (b),\cf3 16.601\cf4 (c), and \cf3 16.601\cf4 (d) for application and limitations, for time-and-materials contracts that also apply to labor-hour contracts. See \cf3 12.207\cf4 (b) for the use of labor-hour contracts for certain commercial services.\

\f0\b 16.603 Letter contracts.\
16.603-1 Description.\

\f1\b0 A letter contract is a written preliminary contractual instrument that authorizes the contractor to begin immediately manufacturing supplies or performing services.\

\f0\b 16.603-2 Application.\

\f1\b0 (a) A letter contract may be used when (1) the Government\'92s interests demand that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that work can start immediately and (2) negotiating a definitive contract is not possible in sufficient time to meet the requirement. However, a letter contract should be as complete and definite as feasible under the circumstances.\

\f1\b0 (b) When a letter contract award is based on price competition, the contracting officer shall include an overall price ceiling in the letter contract.\
(c) Each letter contract shall, as required by the clause at \cf3 52.216-25\cf4 , Contract Definitization, contain a negotiated definitization schedule including (1) dates for submission of the contractor's price proposal, required certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data; and, if required, make-or-buy and subcontracting plans, (2) a date for the start of negotiations, and (3) a target date for definitization, which shall be the earliest practicable date for definitization. The schedule will provide for definitization of the contract within 180 days after the date of the letter contract or before completion of 40 percent of the work to be performed, whichever occurs first. However, the contracting officer may, in extreme cases and according to agency procedures, authorize an additional period. If, after exhausting all reasonable efforts, the contracting officer and the contractor cannot negotiate a definitive contract because of failure to reach agreement as to price or fee, the clause at \cf3 52.216-25 \cf4 requires the contractor to proceed with the work and provides that the contracting officer may, with the approval of the head of the contracting activity, determine a reasonable price or fee in accordance with \cf3 subpart 15.4 \cf4 and \cf3 part 31\cf4 , subject to appeal as provided in the Disputes clause.\
(d) The maximum liability of the Government inserted in the clause at \cf3 52.216-24\cf4 , Limitation of Government Liability, shall be the estimated amount necessary to cover the contractor\'92s requirements for funds before definitization. However, it shall not exceed 50 percent of the estimated cost of the definitive contract unless approved in advance by the official that authorized the letter contract.\
(e) The contracting officer shall assign a priority rating to the letter contract if it is appropriate under \cf3 11.604\cf4 .\

\f0\b 16.603-3 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 A letter contract may be used only after the head of the contracting activity or a designee determines in writing that no other contract is suitable. Letter contracts shall not-\
(a) Commit the Government to a definitive contract in excess of the funds available at the time the letter contract is executed;\
(b) Be entered into without competition when competition is required by \cf3 part 6\cf4 ; or\
(c) Be amended to satisfy a new requirement unless that requirement is inseparable from the existing letter contract. Any such amendment is subject to the same requirements and limitations as a new letter contract.\

\f0\b 16.603-4 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall include in each letter contract the clauses required by this regulation for the type of definitive contract contemplated and any additional clauses known to be appropriate for it.\
(b) In addition, the contracting officer shall insert the following clauses in solicitations and contracts when a letter contract is contemplated:\
(1) The clause at \cf3 52.216-23\cf4 , Execution and Commencement of Work, except that this clause may be omitted from letter contracts awarded on \cf3 SF 26\cf4 ;\
(2) The clause at \cf3 52.216-24\cf4 , Limitation of Government Liability, with dollar amounts completed in a manner consistent with \cf3 16.603-2\cf4 (d); and\
(3) The clause at \cf3 52.216-25\cf4 , Contract Definitization, with its paragraph (b) completed in a manner consistent with \cf3 16.603-2\cf4 (c). If at the time of entering into the letter contract, the contracting officer knows that the definitive contract will be based on adequate price competition or will otherwise meet the criteria of \cf3 15.403-1 \cf4 for not requiring submission of certified cost or pricing data, the words "and certified cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR \cf3 15.408\cf4 , \cf3 Table 15-1 \cf4 supporting\
its proposal" may be deleted from paragraph (a) of the clause. If the letter contract is being awarded on the basis of price competition, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.\
(c) The contracting officer shall also insert the clause at \cf3 52.216-26\cf4 , Payments of Allowable Costs Before Definitization, in solicitations and contracts if a cost-reimbursement definitive contract is contemplated, unless the acquisition involves conversion, alteration, or repair of ships.\

\fs24 Subpart 16.7 - Agreements\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for establishing and using basic agreements and basic ordering agreements. (See \cf3 13.303 \cf4 for blanket purchase agreements (BPA\'92s) and see \cf3 35.015\cf4 (b) for additional coverage of basic agreements with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations.)\

\f0\b 16.702 Basic agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A basic agreement is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency or contracting activity and a contractor, that (1) contains contract clauses applying to future contracts between the parties during its term and (2) contemplates separate future contracts that will incorporate by reference or attachment the required and applicable clauses agreed upon in the basic agreement. A basic agreement is not a contract.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A basic agreement should be used when a substantial number of separate contracts may be awarded to a contractor during a particular period and significant recurring negotiating problems have been experienced with the contractor. Basic agreements may be used with negotiated fixed-price or cost-reimbursement contracts.\
(1) Basic agreements shall contain-\
(i) Clauses required for negotiated contracts by statute, executive order, and this regulation; and\
(ii) Other clauses prescribed in this regulation or agency acquisition regulations that the parties agree to include in\
each contract as applicable.\
(2) Each basic agreement shall provide for discontinuing its future applicability upon 30 days\'92 written notice by either\
party.\
(3) Each basic agreement shall be reviewed annually before the anniversary of its effective date and revised as\
necessary to conform to the requirements of this regulation. Basic agreements may need to be revised before the annual review due to mandatory statutory requirements. A basic agreement may be changed only by modifying the agreement itself and not by a contract incorporating the agreement.\
(4) Discontinuing or modifying a basic agreement shall not affect any prior contract incorporating the basic agreement.\
(5) Contracting officers of one agency should obtain and use existing basic agreements of another agency to the maximum practical extent.\
(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . A basic agreement shall not-\
(1) Cite appropriations or obligate funds;\
(2) State or imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor; or (3) Be used in any manner to restrict competition.\
(d) Contracts incorporating basic agreements. (1) Each contract incorporating a basic agreement shall include a scope of work and price, delivery, and other appropriate terms that apply to the particular contract. The basic agreement shall be incorporated into the contract by specific reference (including reference to each amendment) or by attachment.\
(2) The contracting officer shall include clauses pertaining to subjects not covered by the basic agreement, but applicable to the contract being negotiated, in the same manner as if there were no basic agreement.\
(3) If an existing contract is modified to effect new acquisition, the modification shall incorporate the most recent basic agreement, which shall apply only to work added by the modification, except that this action is not mandatory if the contract or modification includes all clauses required by statute, executive order, and this regulation as of the date of the modification. However, if it is in the Government\'92s interest and the contractor agrees, the modification may incorporate the most recent basic agreement for application to the entire contract as of the date of the modification.\

\f0\b 16.703 Basic ordering agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Description
\f1\i0 . A basic ordering agreement is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2)a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the basic ordering agreement. A basic ordering agreement is not a contract.\
(b) 
\f2\i Application
\f1\i0 . A basic ordering agreement may be used to expedite contracting for uncertain requirements for supplies or services when specific items, quantities, and prices are not known at the time the agreement is executed, but a substantial number of requirements for the type of supplies or services covered by the agreement are anticipated to be purchased\
from the contractor. Under proper circumstances, the use of these procedures can result in economies in ordering parts for\

(c) 
\f2\i Limitations
\f1\i0 . A basic ordering agreement shall not state or imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or be used in any manner to restrict competition.\
(1) Each basic ordering agreement shall-\
(i) Describe the method for determining prices to be paid to the contractor for the supplies or services;\
(ii) Include delivery terms and conditions or specify how they will be determined;\
(iii) List one or more Government activities authorized to issue orders under the agreement;\
(iv) Specify the point at which each order becomes a binding contract (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 issuance of the order, acceptance of the\
order in a specified manner, or failure to reject the order within a specified number of days);\
(v) Provide that failure to reach agreement on price for any order issued before its price is established (see paragraph\
(d)(3) of this section) is a dispute under the Disputes clause included in the basic ordering agreement; and (vi) If fast payment procedures will apply to orders, include the special data required by \cf3 13.403\cf4 .\
(2) Each basic ordering agreement shall be reviewed annually before the anniversary of its effective date and revised as necessary to conform to the requirements of this regulation. Basic ordering agreements may need to be revised before the annual review due to mandatory statutory requirements. A basic ordering agreement shall be changed only by modifying the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under it. Modifying a basic ordering agreement shall not retroactively affect orders previously issued under it.\
(d) 
\f2\i Orders
\f1\i0 . A contracting officer representing any Government activity listed in a basic ordering agreement may issue orders for required supplies or services covered by that agreement.\
(1) Before issuing an order under a basic ordering agreement, the contracting officer shall-\
(i) Obtain competition in accordance with \cf3 part 6\cf4 ;\
(ii) If the order is being placed after competition, ensure that use of the basic ordering agreement is not prejudicial to\
other offerors; and\
(iii) Sign or obtain any applicable justifications and approvals, and any determination and findings, and comply with\
other requirements in accordance with \cf3 1.602-1\cf4 (b), as if the order were a contract awarded independently of a basic ordering agreement.\
(2) Contracting officers shall-\
(i) Issue orders under basic ordering agreements on \cf3 Optional Form (OF) 347\cf4 , Order for Supplies or Services, or on\
any other appropriate contractual instrument;\
(ii) Incorporate by reference the provisions of the basic ordering agreement; (iii) If applicable, cite the authority under \cf3 6.302 \cf4 in each order; and\
(iv) Comply with \cf3 5.203 \cf4 when synopsis is required by \cf3 5.201\cf4 .\
(3) The contracting officer shall neither make any final commitment nor authorize the contractor to begin work on an order under a basic ordering agreement until prices have been established, unless the order establishes a ceiling price limiting the Government\'92s obligation and either-\
(i) The basic ordering agreement provides adequate procedures for timely pricing of the order early in its performance period; or\
(ii) The need for the supplies or services is compelling and unusually urgent (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 when the Government would\
be seriously injured, financially or otherwise, if the requirement is not met sooner than would be possible if prices were established before the work began). The contracting officer shall proceed with pricing as soon as practical. In no event shall an entire order be priced retroactively.\

 17.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services through special contracting methods, including-\
(a) Multi-year contracting;\
(b) Options; and\
(c) Leader company contracting.\

\f0\b 17.101 Authority.\

\fs24 Subpart 17.1 - Multi-year Contracting\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart implements \cf3 41 U.S.C. 3903 \cf4 and \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3501 \cf4 and provides policy and procedures for the use of multi-year contracting.\

\f0\b 17.102 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the authorities cited in \cf3 17.101 \cf4 do not apply to contracts for the purchase of supplies to which \cf3 40 U.S.C.759 \cf4 applies (information resource management supply contracts).\

\f0\b 17.103 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Cancellation 
\f1\i0 means the cancellation (within a contractually specified time) of the total requirements of all remaining program years. Cancellation results when the contracting officer-\
(1) Notifies the contractor of nonavailability of funds for contract performance for any subsequent program year; or\
(2) Fails to notify the contractor that funds are available for performance of the succeeding program year requirement. 
\f2\i Cancellation ceiling 
\f1\i0 means the maximum cancellation charge that the contractor can receive in the event of cancellation. 
\f2\i Cancellation charge 
\f1\i0 means the amount of unrecovered costs which would have been recouped through amortization over\
the full term of the contract, including the term canceled.\

\f2\i Multi-year contract 
\f1\i0 means a contract for the purchase of supplies or services for more than 1, but not more than 5,\
program years. A multi-year contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds, and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if appropriations are not made. The key distinguishing difference between multi-year contracts and multiple year contracts is that multi-year contracts, defined in the statutes cited at \cf3 17.101\cf4 , buy more than 1 year\'92s requirement (of a product or service) without establishing and having to exercise an option for each program year after the first.\

\f2\i Nonrecurring costs 
\f1\i0 means those costs which are generally incurred on a one-time basis and include such costs as plant or equipment relocation, plant rearrangement, special tooling and special test equipment, preproduction engineering, initial spoilage and rework, and specialized work force training.\

\f2\i Recurring costs 
\f1\i0 means costs that vary with the quantity being produced, such as labor and materials.\

\f0\b 17.104 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Multi-year contracting is a special contracting method to acquire known requirements in quantities and total cost not over planned requirements for up to 5 years unless otherwise authorized by statute, even though the total funds ultimately to be obligated may not be available at the time of contract award. This method may be used in sealed bidding or contracting by negotiation.\
(b) Multi-year contracting is a flexible contracting method applicable to a wide range of acquisitions. The extent to which cancellation terms are used in multi-year contracts will depend on the unique circumstances of each contract. Accordingly, for multi-year contracts, the agency head may authorize modification of the requirements of this subpart and the clause at \cf3 52.217-2\cf4 , Cancellation Under Multi-year Contracts.\
(c) Agency funding of multi-year contracts shall conform to the policies in OMB Circulars A-11 (Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates) and A-34 (Instructions on Budget Execution) and other applicable guidance regarding the funding of multi-year contracts. As provided by that guidance, the funds obligated for multi-year contracts must be sufficient to cover any potential cancellation and/or termination costs; and multi-year contracts for the acquisition of fixed assets should be fully funded or funded in stages that are economically or programmatically viable.\

\fs20 (d) The termination for convenience procedure may apply to any Government contract, including multiyear contracts. As contrasted with cancellation, termination can be effected at any time during the life of the contract (cancellation is effected between fiscal years) and can be for the total quantity or partial quantity (where as cancellation must be for all subsequent fiscal years\'92 quantities).\

\f0\b 17.105 Policy.\
17.105-1 Uses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the contracting officer may enter into a multi-year contract if the head of the contracting activity determines that-\
(1) The need for the supplies or services is reasonably firm and continuing over the period of the contract; and\
(2) A multi-year contract will serve the best interests of the United States by encouraging full and open competition or promoting economy in administration, performance, and operation of the agency\'92s programs.\
(b) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the head of the agency may enter into a multi-year contract for supplies if- (1) The use of such a contract will result in significant savings of the total estimated costs of carrying out the program\
through annual contracts;\
(2) The minimum need to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract\
period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;\
(3) There is a stable design for the supplies to be acquired, and the technical risks associated with such supplies are not\
excessive;\
(4) There is a reasonable expectation that, throughout the contemplated contract period, the head of the agency will\
request funding for the contract at a level to avoid contract cancellation; and\
(5) The estimates of both the cost of the contract and the cost avoidance through the use of a multi-year contract are\
realistic.\
(c) The multi-year contracting method may be used for the acquisition of supplies or services.\
(d) If funds are not appropriated to support the succeeding years\'92 requirements, the agency must cancel the contract.\

\f0\b 17.105-2 Objectives.\

\f1\b0 Use of multi-year contracting is encouraged to take advantage of one or more of the following: (a) Lower costs.\
(b) Enhancement of standardization.\
(c) Reduction of administrative burden in the placement and administration of contracts.\
(d) Substantial continuity of production or performance, thus avoiding annual startup costs, preproduction testing costs, make-ready expenses, and phaseout costs.\
(e) Stabilization of contractor work forces.\
(f) Avoidance of the need for establishing quality control techniques and procedures for a new contractor each year.\
(g) Broadening the competitive base with opportunity for participation by firms not otherwise willing or able to compete\
for lesser quantities, particularly in cases involving high startup costs.\
(h) Providing incentives to contractors to improve productivity through investment in capital facilities, equipment, and\
advanced technology.\

\f0\b 17.106 Procedures.\
17.106-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Method of contracting
\f1\i0 . The nature of the requirement should govern the selection of the method of contracting, since the multi-year procedure is compatible with sealed bidding, including two-step sealed bidding, and negotiation.\
(b) 
\f2\i Type of contract. 
\f1\i0 Given the longer performance period associated with multi-year acquisition, consideration in pricing fixed-priced contracts should be given to the use of economic price adjustment terms and profit objectives commensurate with contractor risk and financing arrangements.\
(c) Cancellation procedures. (1) All program years except the first are subject to cancellation. For each program year subject to cancellation, the contracting officer shall establish a cancellation ceiling. Ceilings must exclude amounts\
for requirements included in prior program years. The contracting officer shall reduce the cancellation ceiling for each program year in direct proportion to the remaining requirements subject to cancellation. For example, consider that the total\

\f0\b\fs20 17.106-2\
 
\f1\b0 nonrecurring costs (see \cf3 15.408\cf4 , \cf3 Table 15-1\cf4 , III. Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries C(8)) are estimated at 10 percent of the total multi-year price, and the percentages for each of the program year requirements for 5 years are (i)30 in the firstyear, (ii)30 in the second, (iii)20 in the third, (iv)10 in the fourth, and (v)10 in the fifth. The cancellation percentages, after deducting 3 percent for the first program year, would be 7, 4, 2, and 1 percent of the total price applicable to the second, third, fourth, and fifth program years, respectively.\
(2) In determining cancellation ceilings, the contracting officer must estimate reasonable preproduction or startup, labor learning, and other nonrecurring costs to be incurred by an "average" prime contractor or subcontractor, which would be applicable to, and which normally would be amortized over, the items or services to be furnished under the multi-year requirements. Nonrecurring costs include such costs, where applicable, as plant or equipment relocation or rearrangement, special tooling and special test equipment, preproduction engineering, initial rework, initial spoilage, pilot runs, allocable portions of the costs of facilities to be acquired or established for the conduct of the work, costs incurred for the assembly, training, and transportation to and from the job site of a specialized work force, and unrealized labor learning. They shall not include any costs of labor or materials, or other expenses (except as indicated above), which might be incurred for performance of subsequent program year requirements. The total estimate of the above costs must then be compared with the best estimate of the contract cost to arrive at a reasonable percentage or dollar figure. To perform this calculation, the contracting officer should obtain in-house engineering cost estimates identifying the detailed recurring and nonrecurring costs, and the effect of labor learning.\
(3) The contracting officer shall establish cancellation dates for each program year\'92s requirements regarding production lead time and the date by which funding for these requirements can reasonably be established. The contracting officer shall include these dates in the schedule, as appropriate.\
(d) 
\f2\i Cancellation ceilings
\f1\i0 . Cancellation ceilings and dates may be revised after issuing the solicitation if necessary. In sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall change the ceiling by amending the solicitation before bid opening. In two-step sealed bidding, discussions conducted during the first step may indicate the need for revised ceilings and dates which may be incorporated in step two. In a negotiated acquisition, negotiations with offerors may provide information requiring a change in cancellation ceilings and dates before final negotiation and contract award.\
(e) 
\f2\i Payment of cancellation charges
\f1\i0 . If cancellation occurs, the Government\'92s liability will be determined by the terms of the applicable contract.\
(f) 
\f2\i Presolicitation or pre-bid conferences
\f1\i0 . To ensure that all interested sources of supply are thoroughly aware of how multi-year contracting is accomplished, use of presolicitation or pre-bid conferences may be advisable.\
(g) 
\f2\i Payment limit. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer shall limit the Government\'92s payment obligation to an amount available for contract performance. The contracting officer shall insert the amount for the first program year in the contract upon award and modify it for successive program years upon availability of funds.\
(h) 
\f2\i Termination payment
\f1\i0 . If the contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government in whole, including requirements subject to cancellation, the Government\'92s obligation shall not exceed the amount specified in the Schedule as available for contract performance, plus the cancellation ceiling.\

\f0\b 17.106-2 Solicitations.\

\f1\b0 Solicitations for multi-year contracts shall reflect all the factors to be considered for evaluation, specifically including the following:\
(a) The requirements, by item of supply or service, for the-\
(1) First program year; and\
(2) Multi-year contract including the requirements for each program year.\
(b) Criteria for comparing the lowest evaluated submission on the first program year requirements to the lowest evaluated submission on the multi-year requirements.\
(c) A provision that, if the Government determines before award that only the first program year requirements are needed, the Government\'92s evaluation of the price or estimated cost and fee shall consider only the firstyear.\
(d) A provision specifying a separate cancellation ceiling (on a percentage or dollar basis) and dates applicable to each program year subject to a cancellation (see \cf3 17.106-1\cf4 (c) and (d)).\
(e) A statement that award will not be made on less than the first program year requirements.\
(f) The Government\'92s administrative costs of annual contracting may be used as a factor in the evaluation only if they can be reasonably established and are stated in the solicitation.\
(g) The cancellation ceiling shall not be an evaluation factor.\

\f0\b\fs20 17.106-3 Special procedures applicable to DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Participation by subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors. 
\f1\i0 In order to broaden the defense industrial base, to the maximum extent practicable-\
(1) Multi-year contracting shall be used in such a manner as to seek, retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors; and\
(2) Upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a multi-year contract to any subcontractor, supplier, or vendor company participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable.\
(b) 
\f2\i Protection of existing authority
\f1\i0 . To the extent practicable, multi-year contracting shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude or curtail the existing ability of the Department or agency to provide for termination of a prime contract, the performance of which is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.\
(c) 
\f2\i Cancellation or termination for insufficient funding
\f1\i0 . In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of a multi-year contract awarded using the procedures in this section, the contract shall be canceled or terminated.\
(d) Contracts awarded under the multi-year procedure shall be firm-fixed-price, fixed-price with economic price adjustment, or fixed-price incentive.\
(e) 
\f2\i Recurring costs in cancellation ceiling
\f1\i0 . The inclusion of recurring costs in cancellation ceilings is an exception to normal contract financing arrangements and requires approval by the agency head.\
(f) 
\f2\i Annual and multi-year proposals. 
\f1\i0 Obtaining both annual and multi-year offers provides reduced lead time for making an annual award in the event that the multi-year award is not in the Government\'92s interest. Obtaining both also provides a basis for the computation of savings and other benefits. However, the preparation and evaluation of dual offers may increase administrative costs and workload for both offerors and the Government, especially for large or complex acquisitions. The head of a contracting activity may authorize the use of a solicitation requesting only multi-year prices, provided it is found that such a solicitation is in the Government\'92s interest, and that dual proposals are not necessary to meet the objectives in \cf3 17.105-2\cf4 .\
(g) 
\f2\i Level unit prices
\f1\i0 . Multi-year contract procedures provide for the amortization of certain costs over the entire contract quantity resulting in identical (level) unit prices (except when the economic price adjustment terms apply) for all items or services under the multi-year contract. If level unit pricing is not in the Government\'92s interest, the head of a contracting activity may approve the use of variable unit prices, provided that for competitive proposals there is a valid method of evaluation.\

\f0\b 17.107 Options.\

\f1\b0 Benefits may accrue by including options in a multi-year contract. In that event, contracting officers must follow the requirements of \cf3 subpart 17.2\cf4 . Options should not include charges for plant and equipment already amortized, or other nonrecurring charges which were included in the basic contract.\

\f0\b 17.108 Congressional notification.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, a multi-year contract which includes a cancellation ceiling in excess of $15 million may not be awarded until the head of the agency gives written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the committees on appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate and the appropriate oversight committees of the House and Senate for the agency in question. Information on such committees may not be readily available to contracting officers. Accordingly, agencies should provide such information through its internal regulations. The contract may not be awarded until the thirty-firstday after the date of notification.\
(b) For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, a multi-year contract which includes a cancellation ceiling in excess of $150 million may not be awarded until the head of the agency gives written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the committees on armed services and appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate. The contract may not be awarded until the thirty-firstday after the date of notification.\

\f0\b 17.109 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.217-2\cf4 , Cancellation Under Multi-year Contracts, in solicitations and contracts when a multi-year contract is contemplated.\
(b) 
\f2\i Economic price adjustment clauses
\f1\i0 . Economic price adjustment clauses are adaptable to multi-year contracting needs. When the period of production is likely to warrant a labor and material costs contingency in the contract price, the contracting\

\f1\b0 officer should normally use an economic price adjustment clause (see \cf3 16.203\cf4 ). When contracting for services, the contracting officer-\
(1) Shall add the clause at \cf3 52.222-43\cf4 , Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Labor Standards- Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts), when the contract includes the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards;\
(2) May modify the clause at \cf3 52.222-43 \cf4 in overseas contracts when laws, regulations, or international agreements require contractors to pay higher wage rates; or\
(3) May use an economic price adjustment clause authorized by \cf3 16.203\cf4 , when potential fluctuations require coverage and are not included in cost contingencies provided for by the clause at \cf3 52.222-43\cf4 .\

 17.200 Scope of subpart.\

\fs24 Subpart 17.2 - Options\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for the use of option solicitation provisions and contract clauses. Except as provided in agency regulations, this subpart does not apply to contracts for (a) services involving the construction, alteration, or repair (including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, bridges, roads, or other kinds of real property; (b) architect-engineer services; and (c) research and development services. However, it does not preclude the use of options in those contracts.\

\f0\b 17.201 [Reserved]\
17.202 Use of options.\

\f1\b0 (a) Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, for both sealed bidding and contracting by negotiation, the contracting officer may include options in contracts when it is in the Government\'92s interest. When using sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall make a written determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised before including the provision at \cf3 52.217-5\cf4 , Evaluation of Options, in the solicitation. (See \cf3 17.207\cf4 (f) with regard to the exercise of options.)\
(b) Inclusion of an option is normally not in the Government\'92s interest when, in the judgment of the contracting officer- (1) The foreseeable requirements involve-\
(i) Minimum economic quantities (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 quantities large enough to permit the recovery of startup costs and the production of the required supplies at a reasonable price); and\
(ii) Delivery requirements far enough into the future to permit competitive acquisition, production, and delivery. (2) An indefinite quantity or requirements contract would be more appropriate than a contract with options. However,\
this does not preclude the use of an indefinite quantity contract or requirements contract with options. (c) The contracting officer shall not employ options if-\
(1) The contractor will incur undue risks; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 the price or availability of necessary materials or labor is not reasonably foreseeable;\
(2) Market prices for the supplies or services involved are likely to change substantially; or (3) The option represents known firm requirements for which funds are available unless-\
(i) The basic quantity is a learning or testing quantity; and\
(ii) Competition for the option is impracticable once the initial contract is awarded. (d) In recognition of-\
(1) The Government\'92s need in certain service contracts for continuity of operations; and\
(2) The potential cost of disrupted support, options may be included in service contracts if there is an anticipated need for a similar service beyond the first contract period.\

\f0\b 17.203 Solicitations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Solicitations shall include appropriate option provisions and clauses when resulting contracts will provide for the exercise of options (see \cf3 17.208\cf4 ).\
(b) Solicitations containing option provisions shall state the basis of evaluation, either exclusive or inclusive of the option and, when appropriate, shall inform offerors that it is anticipated that the Government may exercise the option at time of award.\
(c) Solicitations normally should allow option quantities to be offered without limitation as to price, and there shall be no limitation as to price if the option quantity is to be considered in the evaluation for award (see \cf3 17.206\cf4 ).\
(d) Solicitations that allow the offer of options at unit prices which differ from the unit prices for the basic requirement shall state that offerors may offer varying prices for options, depending on the quantities actually ordered and the dates when ordered.\
(e) If it is anticipated that the Government may exercise an option at the time of award and if the condition specified in paragraph (d) of this section applies, solicitations shall specify the price at which the Government will evaluate the option (highest option price offered or option price for specified requirements).\
(f) Solicitations may, in unusual circumstances, require that options be offered at prices no higher than those for the initial requirement; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 when-\
(1) The option cannot be evaluated under \cf3 17.206\cf4 ; or;\

\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (2) Future competition for the option is impracticable.\
(g) Solicitations that require the offering of an option at prices no higher than those for the initial requirement shall-\
(1) Specify that the Government will accept an offer containing an option price higher than the base price only if the acceptance does not prejudice any other offeror; and\
(2) Limit option quantities for additional supplies to not more than 50 percent of the initial quantity of the same line item. In unusual circumstances, an authorized person at a level above the contracting officer may approve a greater percentage of quantity.\
(h) Include the value of options in determining if the acquisition will exceed the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or Free Trade Agreement thresholds.\

\f0\b 17.204 Contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contract shall specify limits on the purchase of additional supplies or services, or the overall duration of the term of the contract, including any extension.\
(b) The contract shall state the period within which the option may be exercised.\
(c) The period shall be set so as to provide the contractor adequate lead time to ensure continuous production.\
(d) The period may extend beyond the contract completion date for service contracts. This is necessary for situations when\
exercise of the option would result in the obligation of funds that are not available in the fiscal year in which the contract would otherwise be completed.\
(e) Unless otherwise approved in accordance with agency procedures, the total of the basic and option periods shall not exceed 5 years in the case of services, and the total of the basic and option quantities shall not exceed the requirement for 5 years in the case of supplies. These limitations do not apply to information technology contracts. However, statutes applicable to various classes of contracts, for example, the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (see \cf3 22.1002-1\cf4 ), may place additional restrictions on the length of contracts.\
(f) Contracts may express options for increased quantities of supplies or services in terms of- (1) Percentage of specific line items,\
(2) Increase in specific line items; or\
(3) Additional numbered line items identified as the option.\
(g) Contracts may express extensions of the term of the contract as an amended completion date or as additional time for performance; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 days, weeks, or months.\

\f0\b 17.205 Documentation.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall justify in writing the quantities or the term under option, the notification period for exercising the option, and any limitation on option price under \cf3 17.203\cf4 (g); and shall include the justification document in the contract file.\
(b) Any justifications and approvals and any determination and findings required by \cf3 part 6 \cf4 shall specify both the basic requirement and the increase permitted by the option.\

\f0\b 17.206 Evaluation.\

\f1\b0 (a) In awarding the basic contract, the contracting officer shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, evaluate offers for any option quantities or periods contained in a solicitation when it has been determined prior to soliciting offers that the Government is likely to exercise the options. (See \cf3 17.208\cf4 .)\
(b) The contracting officer need not evaluate offers for any option quantities when it is determined that evaluation would not be in the best interests of the Government and this determination is approved at a level above the contracting officer. An example of a circumstance that may support a determination not to evaluate offers for option quantities is when there is a reasonable certainty that funds will be unavailable to permit exercise of the option.\

\f0\b 17.207 Exercise of options.\

\f1\b0 (a) When exercising an option, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor within the time period specified in the contract.\
(b) When the contract provides for economic price adjustment and the contractor requests a revision of the price, the contracting officer shall determine the effect of the adjustment on prices under the option before the option is exercised.\
(c) The contracting officer may exercise options only after determining that- (1) Funds are available;\

\fs16 PTIONS 
\f0\b\fs20 17.208\
 
\f1\b0 (2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing Government need;\
(3) The exercise of the option is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government\'92s need, price and other factors (see paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section) considered;\
(4) The option was synopsized in accordance with \cf3 part 5 \cf4 unless exempted by \cf3 5.202\cf4 (a)(11) or other appropriate exemptions in \cf3 5.202\cf4 ;\
(5) The contractor does not have an active exclusion record in the System for Award Management (see FAR \cf3 9.405-1\cf4 ); (6) The contractor\'92s past performance evaluations on other contract actions have been considered; and\
(7) The contractor\'92s performance on this contract has been acceptable, e.g., received satisfactory ratings.\
(d) The contracting officer, after considering price and other factors, shall make the determination on the basis of one of the following:\
(1) A new solicitation fails to produce a better price or a more advantageous offer than that offered by the option. If it is anticipated that the best price available is the option price or that this is the more advantageous offer, the contracting officer should not use this method of testing the market.\
(2) An informal analysis of prices or an examination of the market indicates that the option price is better than prices available in the market or that the option is the more advantageous offer.\
(3) The time between the award of the contract containing the option and the exercise of the option is so short that it indicates the option price is the lowest price obtainable or the more advantageous offer. The contracting officer shall take into consideration such factors as market stability and comparison of the time since award with the usual duration of contracts for such supplies or services.\
(e) The determination of other factors under paragraph (c)(3) of this section
\f2\i -\

\f1\i0 (1) Should take into account the Government\'92s need for continuity of operations and potential costs of disrupting\
operations; and\
(2) May consider the effect on small business.\
(f) Before exercising an option, the contracting officer shall make a written determination for the contract file that exercise is in accordance with the terms of the option, the requirements of this section, and \cf3 part 6\cf4 . To satisfy requirements of \cf3 part 6 \cf4 regarding full and open competition, the option must have been evaluated as part of the initial competition and be exercisable at an amount specified in or reasonably determinable from the terms of the basic contract, 
\f2\i e.g.-\

\f1\i0 (1) A specific dollar amount;\
(2) An amount to be determined by applying provisions (or a formula) provided in the basic contract, but not including renegotiation of the price for work in a fixed-price type contract;\
(3) In the case of a cost-type contract, if-\
(i) The option contains a fixed or maximum fee; or\
(ii) The fixed or maximum fee amount is determinable by applying a formula contained in the basic contract (but see\
\cf3 16.102\cf4 (c));\
(4) A specific price that is subject to an economic price adjustment provision; or\
(5) A specific price that is subject to change as the result of changes to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary\
of Labor.\
(g) The contract modification or other written document which notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option shall\

\fs24 Subpart 17.4 - Leader Company Contracting\

\fs20 17.401 General.\

\f1\b0 Leader company contracting is an extraordinary acquisition technique that is limited to special circumstances and utilized only when its use is in accordance with agency procedures. A developer or sole producer of a product or system is designated under this acquisition technique to be the leader company, and to furnish assistance and know-how under an approved contract to one or more designated follower companies, so they can become a source of supply. The objectives of this technique are one or more of the following:\
(a) Reduce delivery time.\
(b) Achieve geographic dispersion of suppliers.\
(c) Maximize the use of scarce tooling or special equipment.\
(d) Achieve economies in production.\
(e) Ensure uniformity and reliability in equipment, compatibility or standardization of components, and interchangeability\
of parts.\
(f) Eliminate problems in the use of proprietary data that cannot be resolved by more satisfactory solutions.\
(g) Facilitate the transition from development to production and to subsequent competitive acquisition of end items or\
major components.\

\f0\b 17.402 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Leader company contracting is to be used only when-\
(1) The leader company has the necessary production know-how and is able to furnish required assistance to the\
follower(s);\
(2) No other source can meet the Government\'92s requirements without the assistance of a leader company;\
(3) The assistance required of the leader company is limited to that which is essential to enable the follower(s) to\
produce the items; and\
(4) Its use is authorized in accordance with agency procedures.\
(b) When leader company contracting is used, the Government shall reserve the right to approve subcontracts between the leader company and the follower(s).\

\f0\b 17.403 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer may award a prime contract to a-\
(1) Leader company, obligating it to subcontract a designated portion of the required end items to a specified follower\
company and to assist it to produce the required end items;\
(2) Leader company, for the required assistance to a follower company, and a prime contract to the follower for\
production of the items; or\
(3) Follower company, obligating it to subcontract with a designated leader company for the required assistance.\
(b) The contracting officer shall ensure that any contract awarded under this arrangement contains a firm agreement regarding disclosure, if any, of contractor trade secrets, technical designs or concepts, and specific data, or software, of a proprietary nature.\

\fs24 Subpart 17.5 - Interagency Acquisitions\

\fs20 17.500 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 (a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures applicable to all interagency acquisitions under any authority, except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section. In addition to complying with the interagency acquisition policy and procedures in this subpart, nondefense agencies acquiring supplies and services on behalf of the Department of Defense shall also comply with the policy and procedures at \cf3 subpart 17.7\cf4 .\
(b) This subpart applies to interagency acquisitions, see \cf3 2.101 \cf4 for definition, when-\
(1) An agency needing supplies or services obtains them using another agency\'92s contract; or\
(2) An agency uses another agency to provide acquisition assistance, such as awarding and administering a contract, a\
task order, or delivery order.\
(c) This subpart does not apply to-\
(1) Interagency reimbursable work performed by Federal employees (other than acquisition assistance), or interagency activities where contracting is incidental to the purpose of the transaction; or\
(2) Orders of $600,000 or less issued against Federal Supply Schedules.\

\f0\b 17.501 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Interagency acquisitions are commonly conducted through indefinite-delivery contracts, such as task- and delivery- order contracts. The indefinite-delivery contracts used most frequently to support interagency acquisitions are Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and multi-agency contracts (MACs).\
(b) An agency shall not use an interagency acquisition to circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of funds.\
(c) An interagency acquisition is not exempt from the requirements of subpart \cf3 7.3\cf4 , Contractor Versus Government Performance.\
(d) An agency shall not use an interagency acquisition to make acquisitions conflicting with any other agency\'92s authority or responsibility (for example, that of the Administrator of General Services under \cf3 title 40, United States Code\cf4 , "Public Buildings, Property and Works" and \cf3 41 U.S.C. division C of subtitle I\cf4 , Procurement.)\

\f0\b 17.502 Procedures. 17.502-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Written agreement on responsibility for management and administration\'97. 
\f1\i0 (1) 
\f2\i Assisted acquisitions
\f1\i0 . (i) Prior\
to the issuance of a solicitation, the servicing agency and the requesting agency shall both sign a written interagency agreement that establishes the general terms and conditions governing the relationship between the parties, including roles and responsibilities for acquisition planning, contract execution, and administration and management of the contract(s) or order(s). The requesting agency shall provide to the servicing agency any unique terms, conditions, and applicable agency- specific statutes, regulations, directives, and other applicable requirements for incorporation into the order or contract. In the event there are no agency unique requirements beyond the FAR, the requesting agency shall so inform the servicing agency contracting officer in writing. For acquisitions on behalf of the Department of Defense, also see \cf3 subpart 17.7\cf4 . For patent rights, see \cf3 27.304-2\cf4 . In preparing interagency agreements to support assisted acquisitions, agencies should review the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) guidance, Interagency Acquisitions, available at \cf3 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/assets/OMB/procurement/interagency_acq/iac_revised.pdf \cf4 .\
(ii) Each agency\'92s file shall include the interagency agreement between the requesting and servicing agency, and shall include sufficient documentation to ensure an adequate audit consistent with \cf3 4.801\cf4 (b).\
(2) 
\f2\i Direct acquisitions
\f1\i0 . The requesting agency administers the order; therefore, no written agreement with the servicing agency is required.\
(b) 
\f2\i Business-case analysis requirements for multi-agency contracts and governmentwide acquisition contracts
\f1\i0 . In order to establish a multi-agency or governmentwide acquisition contract, a business-case analysis must be prepared by the servicing agency and approved in accordance with the OFPP business case guidance, available at \cf3 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/procurement/memo/development-review-and-approval-of-business-cases-for- certain-interagency-and-agency-specific-acquisitions-memo.pdf \cf4 .

\fs20 (2) Detail the administration of such contract, including an analysis of all direct and indirect costs to the Government of awarding and administering such contract;\
(3) Describe the impact such contract will have on the ability of the Government to leverage its purchasing power, 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , will it have a negative effect because it dilutes other existing contracts;\
(4) Include an analysis concluding that there is a need for establishing the multi-agency contract; and (5) Document roles and responsibilities in the administration of the contract.\

\f0\b 17.502-2 The Economy Act.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Economy Act (\cf3 31 U.S.C.1535\cf4 ) authorizes agencies to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from another agency. The FAR applies when one agency uses another agency\'92s contract to obtain supplies or services. If the interagency business transaction does not result in a contract or an order, then the FAR does not apply. The Economy Act also provides authority for placement of orders between major organizational units within an agency; procedures for such intra- agency transactions are addressed in agency regulations.\
(b) The Economy Act applies when more specific statutory authority does not exist. Examples of more specific authority are \cf3 40 U.S.C. 501 \cf4 for the Federal Supply Schedules (subpart \cf3 8.4\cf4 ), and 
\f2\i 40 U.S.C. 11302
\f1\i0 (
\f2\i e) 
\f1\i0 for Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs).\
(c) Requirements for determinations and findings. (1) Each Economy Act order to obtain supplies or services by interagency acquisition shall be supported by a determination and findings (D&F). The D&F shall-\
(i) State that use of an interagency acquisition is in the best interest of the Government;\
(ii) State that the supplies or services cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a private source; and\
(iii) Include a statement that at least one of the following circumstances applies:\
(A) The acquisition will appropriately be made under an existing contract of the servicing agency, entered into\
before placement of the order, to meet the requirements of the servicing agency for the same or similar supplies or services. (B) The servicing agency has the capability or expertise to enter into a contract for such supplies or services that\
is not available within the requesting agency.\
(C) The servicing agency is specifically authorized by law or regulation to purchase such supplies or services on\
behalf of other agencies.\
(2) The D&F shall be approved by a contracting officer of the requesting agency with authority to contract for the\
supplies or services to be ordered, or by another official designated by the agency head, except that, if the servicing agency is not covered by the FAR, approval of the D&F may not be delegated below the senior procurement executive of the requesting agency.\
(3) The requesting agency shall furnish a copy of the D&F to the servicing agency with the request for order.\
(d) Payment. (1) The servicing agency may ask the requesting agency, in writing, for advance payment for all or part of\
the estimated cost of furnishing the supplies or services. Adjustment on the basis of actual costs shall be made as agreed to by the agencies.\
(2) If approved by the servicing agency, payment for actual costs may be made by the requesting agency after the supplies or services have been furnished.\
(3) Bills rendered or requests for advance payment shall not be subject to audit or certification in advance of payment.\
(4) In no event shall the servicing agency require, or the requesting agency pay, any fee or charge in excess of the actual cost (or estimated cost if the actual cost is not known) of entering into and administering the contract or other agreement under which the order is filled.\

\f0\b 17.503 Ordering procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Before placing an order for supplies or services with another Government agency, the requesting agency shall follow the procedures in \cf3 17.502-1 \cf4 and, if under the Economy Act, also \cf3 17.502-2\cf4 .\
(b) The order may be placed on any form or document that is acceptable to both agencies. The order should include- (1) A description of the supplies or services required;\
(2) Delivery requirements;\
(3) A funds citation;\
(4) A payment provision (see \cf3 17.502-2\cf4 (d) for Economy Act orders); and (5) Acquisition authority as may be appropriate (see \cf3 17.503\cf4 (d)).\

\f1\b0 (c) The requesting and servicing agencies should agree to procedures for the resolution of disagreements that may arise under interagency acquisitions, including, in appropriate circumstances, the use of a third-party forum. If a third party is proposed, consent of the third party should be obtained in writing.\
(d) When an interagency acquisition requires the servicing agency to award a contract, the following procedures also apply:\
(1) If a justification and approval or a D&F (other than the requesting agency\'92s D&F required in \cf3 17.502-2\cf4 (c)) is required by law or regulation, the servicing agency shall execute and issue the justification and approval or D&F. The requesting agency shall furnish the servicing agency any information needed to make the justification and approval or D&F.\
(2) The requesting agency shall also be responsible for furnishing other assistance that may be necessary, such as providing information or special contract terms needed to comply with any condition or limitation applicable to the funds of the requesting agency.\
(3) The servicing agency is responsible for compliance with all other legal or regulatory requirements applicable to the contract, including-\
(i) Having adequate statutory authority for the contractual action; and\
(ii) Complying fully with the competition requirements of \cf3 part 6 \cf4 (see \cf3 6.002\cf4 ). However, if the servicing agency\
is not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the requesting agency shall verify that contracts utilized to meet its requirements contain provisions protecting the Government from inappropriate charges (for example, provisions mandated for FAR agencies by part \cf3 31\cf4 ), and that adequate contract administration will be provided.\
(e) Nonsponsoring Federal agencies may use a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) only if\
the terms of the FFRDC\'92s sponsoring agreement permit work from other than a sponsoring agency. Work placed with the FFRDC is subject to the acceptance by the sponsor and must fall within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC. (See \cf3 35.017\cf4 ; see also \cf3 6.302 \cf4 for procedures to follow where using other than full and open competition.) The nonsponsoring agency shall provide to the sponsoring agency necessary documentation that the requested work would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry.\

\f0\b 17.504 Reporting requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) The senior procurement executive for each executive agency shall submit to the Director of OMB an annual report on interagency acquisitions, as directed by OMB.\
(b) The contracting officer for the servicing agency shall ensure that service contractor reporting requirements are met in accordance with \cf3 subpart 4.17\cf4 , Service Contracts Inventory.\

\fs24 Subpart 17.6 - Management and Operating Contracts\

\fs20 17.600 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for management and operating contracts for the Department of Energy and any other agency having requisite statutory authority.\

\f0\b 17.601 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Management and operating contract 
\f1\i0 means an agreement under which the Government contracts for the operation, maintenance, or support, on its behalf, of a Government-owned or -controlled research, development, special production, or testing establishment wholly or principally devoted to one or more major programs of the contracting Federal agency.\

\f0\b 17.602 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Heads of agencies, with requisite statutory authority, may determine in writing to authorize contracting officers to enter into or renew any management and operating contract in accordance with the agency\'92s statutory authority, or \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 33\cf4 , and the agency\'92s regulations governing such contracts. This authority shall not be delegated. Every contract so authorized shall show its authorization upon its face.\
(b) Agencies may authorize management and operating contracts only in a manner consistent with the guidance of this subpart and only if they are consistent with the situations described in \cf3 17.604\cf4 .\
(c) Within 2 years of the effective date of this regulation, agencies shall review their current contractual arrangements in the light of the guidance of this subpart, in order to-\
(1) Identify, modify as necessary, and authorize management and operating contracts; and\
(2) Modify as necessary or terminate contracts not so identified and authorized, except that any contract with less than 4 years remaining as of the effective date of this regulation need not be terminated, nor need it be identified, modified, or authorized unless it is renewed or its terms are substantially renegotiated.\

\f0\b 17.603 Limitations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Management and operating contracts shall not be authorized for-\
(1) Functions involving the direction, supervision, or control of Government personnel, except for supervision\
incidental to training;\
(2) Functions involving the exercise of police or regulatory powers in the name of the Government, other than guard or\
plant protection services;\
(3) Functions of determining basic Government policies;\
(4) Day-to-day staff or management functions of the agency or of any of its elements; or\
(5) Functions that can more properly be accomplished in accordance with \cf3 subpart 45.3\cf4 , Authorizing the Use and\
Rental of Government Property.\
(b) Since issuance of an authorization under \cf3 17.602\cf4 (a) is deemed sufficient proof of compliance with paragraph (a)\
immediately above, nothing in paragraph (a) immediately above shall affect the validity or legality of such an authorization. (c) For use of project labor agreements, see subpart \cf3 22.5\cf4 .\

\f0\b 17.604 Identifying management and operating contracts.\

\f1\b0 A management and operating contract is characterized both by its purpose (see \cf3 17.601\cf4 ) and by the special relationship it creates between Government and contractor. The following criteria can generally be applied in identifying management and operating contracts:\
(a) Government-owned or -controlled facilities must be utilized; for instance-\
(1) In the interest of national defense or mobilization readiness;\
(2) To perform the agency\'92s mission adequately; or\
(3) Because private enterprise is unable or unwilling to use its own facilities for the work.\
(b) Because of the nature of the work, or because it is to be performed in Government facilities, the Government must maintain a special, close relationship with the contractor and the contractor\'92s personnel in various important areas (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 safety, security, cost control, site conditions).\
(c) The conduct of the work is wholly or at least substantially separate from the contractor\'92s other business, if any. (d) The work is closely related to the agency\'92s mission and is of a long-term or continuing nature, and there is a need-\
(1) To ensure its continuity; and\

\f1\b0 F
\fs16 EDERAL 
\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION 
\fs20 (2) For special protection covering the orderly transition of personnel and work in the event of a change in contractors.\

\f0\b 17.605 Award, renewal, and extension.\

\f1\b0 (a) Effective work performance under management and operating contracts usually involves high levels of expertise\
and continuity of operations and personnel. Because of program requirements and the unusual (sometimes unique) nature\
of the work performed under management and operating contracts, the Government is often limited in its ability to effect competition or to replace a contractor. Therefore contracting officers should take extraordinary steps before award to assure themselves that the prospective contractor\'92s technical and managerial capacity are sufficient, that organizational conflicts of interest are adequately covered, and that the contract will grant the Government broad and continuing rights to involve itself, if necessary, in technical and managerial decisionmaking concerning performance.\
(b) The contracting officer shall review each management and operating contract, following agency procedures, at appropriate intervals and at least once every 5 years. The review should determine whether meaningful improvement in performance or cost might reasonably be achieved. Any extension or renewal of an operating and management contract must be authorized at a level within the agency no lower than the level at which the original contract was authorized in accordance with \cf3 17.602\cf4 (a).\
(c) Replacement of an incumbent contractor is usually based largely upon expectation of meaningful improvement in performance or cost. Therefore, when reviewing contractor performance, contracting officers should consider-\
(1) The incumbent contractor\'92s overall performance, including, specifically, technical, administrative, and cost performance;\
(2) The potential impact of a change in contractors on program needs, including safety, national defense, and mobilization considerations; and\
(3) Whether it is likely that qualified offerors will compete for the contract.\

\f0\b 19.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Concern 
\f1\i0 means any business entity organized for profit (even if its ownership is in the hands of a nonprofit entity) with\
a place of business located in the United States or its outlying areas and that makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes and/or use of American products, material and/or labor, etc. "Concern" includes but is not limited to an individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association, or cooperative. For more information, see 13 CFR 121.105.\

\f2\i Fair market price 
\f1\i0 means a price based on reasonable costs under normal competitive conditions and not on lowest possible cost (see \cf3 19.202-6\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Industry 
\f1\i0 means all concerns primarily engaged in similar lines of activity, as listed and described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) manual.\

\f2\i Similarly situated entity 
\f1\i0 means a first-tier subcontractor, including an independent contractor, that\'97\
(1) Has the same small business program status as that which qualified the prime contractor for the award (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , for a\
small business set-aside contract, any small business concern, without regard to socioeconomic status); and\
(2) Is considered small for the size standard under the NAICS code the prime contractor assigned to the subcontract.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 19.1 - Size Standards\

\fs20 19.101 [Reserved]\
19.102 Small business size standards and North American Industry Classification System codes.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Locating size standards and North American Industry Classification System codes. 
\f1\i0 (1) SBA establishes small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis. Small business size standards and corresponding North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are provided at \cf3 13 CFR 121.201\cf4 . They are also available at 
\f2\i \cf3 https://www.sba.gov/ document/support--table-size-standards

\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (2) NAICS codes are updated by the Office of Management and Budget through its Economic Classification Policy Committee every five years. New NAICS codes are not available for use in Federal contracting until SBA publishes corresponding size standards. NAICS codes are available from the U.S. Census Bureau at \cf3 https://www.census.gov/naics/\cf4 .\
(3) SBA determines the size status of a concern, including its affiliates, as of the date the concern represents that it is small to the contracting officer as part of its initial offer, which includes price.\
(4) When an agency uses a solicitation for a multiple-award contract that does not require offers for the contract to include price, SBA determines size as of the date of initial offer for the multiple-award contract, whether or not the offer includes price or the price is evaluated. (See \cf3 13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(iv)\cf4 ).\
(b) 
\f2\i Determining the appropriate NAICS codes for the solicitation. 
\f1\i0 (1) Unless required to do otherwise by paragraph (b)(2) (ii)(B) of this section, contracting officers shall assign one NAICS code and corresponding size standard to all solicitations, contracts, and task and delivery orders. The contracting officer shall determine the appropriate NAICS code by classifying the product or service being acquired in the one industry that best describes the principal purpose of the supply or service being acquired. Primary consideration is given to the industry descriptions in the U.S. NAICS Manual, the product or service descriptions in the solicitation, the relative value and importance of the components of the requirement making up the end item being procured, and the function of the goods or services being purchased. A procurement is usually classified according to the component that accounts for the greatest percentage of contract value.\
(2) (i) For solicitations issued on or before October 1, 2025, that will result in multiple-award contracts, the contracting officer shall assign a NAICS code in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\
(ii) For solicitations issued after October 1, 2025, that will result in multiple-award contracts, the contracting officer shall\'96\
(A) Assign a single NAICS code (and corresponding size standard) that best describes the principal purpose of both the acquisition and each subsequent order; or\
(B) Divide the acquisition into distinct portions or categories (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , line item numbers, Special Item Numbers, sectors, functional areas, or equivalent) and assign each portion or category a single NAICS code and size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the supplies or services to be acquired under that distinct portion or category.\
(3) (i) When placing orders under multiple-award contracts with a single NAICS code, the contracting officer shall assign the order the same NAICS code and corresponding size standard designated in the contract.\
(ii) When placing orders under multiple-award contracts with more than one NAICS code, the contracting officer shall assign the order the NAICS code and corresponding size standard designated in the contract for the distinct portion or category against which the order is placed. If an order covers multiple portions or categories, select the NAICS code and corresponding size standard designated in the contract for the distinct portion or category that best represents the principal purpose of the order.\
(4) The contracting officer's designation is final unless appealed in accordance with the procedures in \cf3 19.103\cf4 .\
(c) 
\f2\i Application of small business size standards to solicitations. 
\f1\i0 (1) The contracting officer shall apply the size standard in\
effect on the date the solicitation is issued.\
(2) The contracting officer may amend the solicitation and use the new size standard if SBA amends the size standard\
and it becomes effective before the due date for receipt of initial offers.\

\f0\b 19.103 Appealing the contracting officer's North American Industry Classification System code and size standard determination.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer\'92s determination is final unless appealed as follows:\
(1) An appeal of a contracting officer\'92s NAICS code designation and the applicable size standard shall be served and\
filed within 10 calendar days after the issuance of the initial solicitation or any amendment affecting the NAICS code or size standard. However, SBA may file a NAICS code appeal at any time before offers are due.\
(2) Appeals of a contracting officer's NAICS code designation or applicable size standard may be filed with SBA\'92s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) by\'97\
(i) Any person adversely affected by a NAICS code designation or applicable size standard. However, with respect to a particular sole source 8(a) contract, only the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development may appeal a NAICS code designation; or\
(ii) The Associate or Assistant Director for the SBA program involved, through SBA\'92s Office of General Counsel. (3) Contracting officers shall advise the public, by amendment to the solicitation, of the existence of a NAICS code appeal (see \cf3 5.102\cf4 (a)(1)). Such notices shall include the procedures and the deadline for interested parties to file and serve\
arguments concerning the appeal. 19.1-2\

(5) NAICS code appeals are filed in accordance with \cf3 13 CFR 121.1103\cf4 .\
(6) Upon receipt of a NAICS code appeal, OHA will notify the contracting officer by a notice and order of the date\
OHA received the appeal, the docket number, and the Administrative Judge assigned to the case. The contracting officer's response to the appeal, if any, shall include argument and evidence (see \cf3 13 CFR part 134\cf4 ), and shall be received by OHA within 15 calendar days from the date of the docketing notice and order, unless otherwise specified by the Administrative Judge. Upon receipt of OHA\'92s docketing notice and order, the contracting officer shall withhold award, unless withholding award is not in the best interests of the Government, and immediately send to OHA an electronic link to or a paper copy of both the original solicitation and all amendments relating to the NAICS code appeal. The contracting officer shall inform OHA of any amendments, actions, or developments concerning the procurement in question.\
(7) After close of record, OHA will issue a decision and inform the contracting officer. If OHA\'92s decision is received by the contracting officer before the date the offers are due, the decision shall be final and the solicitation shall be amended to reflect the decision, if appropriate. OHA\'92s decision received after the due date of the initial offers shall not apply to the pending solicitation but shall apply to future solicitations of the same products or services.\
(b) SBA\'92s regulations concerning appeals of NAICS code designations are located at \cf3 13 CFR 121.1102 \cf4 to \cf3 121.1103 \cf4 and \cf3 13 CFR part 134\cf4 .\

(d) Small business specialists shall be appointed and act in accordance with agency regulations.\
(1) The contracting activity shall coordinate with the small business specialist as early in the acquisition planning process as practicable, but no later than 30 days before the issuance of a solicitation, or prior to placing an order without a solicitation when the acquisition meets the dollar thresholds set forth at \cf3 7.107-4\cf4 (a)(1). See also \cf3 7.104\cf4 (d).\
(2) The small business specialist shall notify the agency's Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, and for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs, when the criteria relating to substantial bundling at \cf3 7.107-4\cf4 (a)(1) are met.\
(3) The small business specialist shall coordinate with the contracting activity and the SBA PCR on all determinations and findings required by \cf3 7.107 \cf4 for consolidation or bundling of contract requirements.\

\f0\b 19.202 Specific policies.\

\f1\b0 In order to further the policy in \cf3 19.201 \cf4 (a), contracting officers shall comply with the specific policies listed in this section and shall consider recommendations of the agency Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, or for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs, or the Director\'92s designee, as\
to whether a particular acquisition should be awarded under subpart \cf3 19.5\cf4 , \cf3 19.8\cf4 , \cf3 19.13\cf4 , \cf3 19.14\cf4 , or \cf3 19.15\cf4 . Agencies shall establish procedures including dollar thresholds for review of acquisitions by the Director or the Director's designee for the purpose of making these recommendations. The contracting officer shall document the contract file whenever the Director's recommendations are not accepted, in accordance with \cf3 19.506\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.202-1 Encouraging small business participation in acquisitions.\

\f1\b0 Small business concerns shall be afforded an equitable opportunity to compete for all contracts that they can perform to the extent consistent with the Government\'92s interest. When applicable, the contracting officer shall take the following actions:\
(a) Divide proposed acquisitions of supplies and services (except construction) into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement.\
(b) Plan acquisitions such that, if practicable, more than one small business concern may perform the work, if the work exceeds the amount for which a surety may be guaranteed by SBA against loss under \cf3 15 U.S.C.694b\cf4 .\
(c) Ensure that delivery schedules are established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government.\
(d) Encourage prime contractors to subcontract with small business concerns (see \cf3 subpart 19.7\cf4 ).\
(e) (1) Provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package and other reasonably obtainable information related to the acquisition to the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation if\'97\
(i) The proposed acquisition is for supplies or services currently being provided by a small business and the proposed acquisition is of a quantity or estimated dollar value, the magnitude of which makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;\

\fs16 OLICIES 
\f0\b\fs20 19.202-5\
 
\f1\b0 (ii) The proposed acquisition is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects and the magnitude of this consolidation makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;\
(iii) The proposed acquisition is for a consolidated or bundled requirement. (See \cf3 7.107-5\cf4 (a) for mandatory 30-day notice requirement to incumbent small business concerns.) The contracting officer shall provide all information relative to the justification for the consolidation or bundling, including the acquisition plan or strategy, and if the acquisition involves substantial bundling, the information identified in \cf3 7.107-4\cf4 . The contracting officer shall also provide the same information to the agency Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization: or\
(iv) The acquisition will be reviewed at the PCR's discretion.\
(2) For acquisitions described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, provide a statement explaining why the\
\'97\
(i) Proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to\
permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;\
(ii) Delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to\
the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government;\
(iii) Proposed acquisition cannot be structured so as to make it likely that small businesses can compete for the\
prime contract;\
(iv) Consolidated construction project cannot be acquired as separate discrete projects; or (v) Consolidation or bundling is necessary and justified.\
(3) Process the 30-day notification concurrently with other processing steps required prior to the issuance of the solicitation.\
(4) If the contracting officer rejects the SBA PCR\'92s recommendation made in accordance with \cf3 19.402\cf4 (c)(2), document the basis for the rejection and notify the SBA PCR in accordance with 19.502-8.\

\f0\b 19.202-2 Locating small business sources.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall, to the extent practicable, encourage maximum participation by small business, veteran- owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in acquisitions by taking the following actions:\
(a) Before issuing solicitations, make every reasonable effort to find additional small business concerns (see \cf3 10.002\cf4 (b)(2)). This effort should include contacting the agency small business specialist and SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)).\
(b) Publicize solicitations and contract awards through the Governmentwide point of entry (see \cf3 subparts 5.2 \cf4 and \cf3 5.3\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 19.202-3 Equal low bids.\

\f1\b0 In the event of equal low bids (see \cf3 14.408-6\cf4 ), awards shall be made first to small business concerns which are also labor surplus area concerns, and second to small business concerns which are not also labor surplus area concerns.\

\f0\b 19.202-4 Solicitation.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall encourage maximum response to solicitations by small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns by taking the following actions:\
(a) Allow the maximum amount of time practicable for the submission of offers.\
(b) Furnish specifications, plans, and drawings with solicitations, or furnish information as to where they may be obtained or examined.\
(c) Provide to any small business concern, upon its request, a copy of solicitations with respect to any contract to be let, the name and telephone number of an agency contact to answer questions related to such prospective contract and adequate citations to each major Federal law or agency rule with which such business concern must comply in performing such contract other than laws or agency rules with which the small business must comply when doing business with other than the Government.\

\f0\b 19.202-5 Data collection and reporting requirements.\

\f1\b0 Agencies shall measure the extent of small business participation in their acquisition programs by taking the following actions:\

\fs20 (a) Require each prospective contractor to represent whether it is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, EDWOSB concern, or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program (see the provision at \cf3 52.219-1\cf4 , Small Business Program Representations).\
(b) Accurately measure the extent of participation by small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in Government acquisitions in terms of the total value of contracts placed during each fiscal year, and report data to the SBA at the end of each fiscal year (see \cf3 subpart 4.6\cf4 ).\
(c) When the contract includes the clause at \cf3 52.219-28\cf4 , Post Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, and the conditions in the clause for rerepresenting are met\'97\
(1) Require a contractor that represented itself as any of the small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) prior to award of the contract to rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , 8(a), small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, EDWOSB, or WOSB status); and\
(2) Permit a contractor that represented itself as other than a small business concern prior to award to rerepresent its size status.\

\f0\b 19.202-6 Determination of fair market price.\

\f1\b0 (a) The fair market price shall be the price achieved in accordance with the reasonable price guidelines in \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (b) for- (1) Total and partial small business set-asides, and reserves (see \cf3 subpart 19.5\cf4 );\
(2) HUBZone set-asides (see \cf3 subpart 19.13\cf4 );\
(3) Contracts utilizing the price evaluation preference for HUBZone small business concerns (see \cf3 subpart 19.13\cf4 );\
(4) Set-asides for SDVOSB concerns eligible under the SDVOSB Program (see subpart \cf3 19.14\cf4 );\
(5) Set-asides for EDWOSB concerns and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program (see subpart \cf3 19.15\cf4 ). (b) For 8(a) contracts, both with respect to meeting the requirement at \cf3 19.806\cf4 (b) and in order to accurately estimate the\
current fair market price, contracting officers shall follow the procedures at \cf3 19.807\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.203 Relationship among small business programs.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) Program (subpart \cf3 19.8\cf4 ), HUBZone Program (subpart \cf3 19.13\cf4 ), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Program (subpart \cf3 19.14\cf4 ), or the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program (subpart \cf3 19.15\cf4 ).\
(b) 
\f2\i At or below the simplified acquisition threshold
\f1\i0 . For acquisitions of supplies or services that have an anticipated dollar value above the micro-purchase threshold, but at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, the requirement at \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 (a) to set aside acquisitions for small business concerns does not preclude the contracting officer from awarding a contract to a small business under the 8(a) Program, HUBZone Program, SDVOSB Program, or WOSB Program.\
(c) 
\f2\i Above the simplified acquisition threshold
\f1\i0 . For acquisitions of supplies or services that have an anticipated dollar value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold definition at \cf3 2.101\cf4 , the contracting officer shall first consider an acquisition for the small business socioeconomic contracting programs (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs) before considering a small business set-aside (see \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 (b)). However, if a requirement has been accepted by the SBA under the 8(a) Program, it must remain in the 8(a) Program unless the SBA agrees to its release in accordance with 13 CFR parts 124, 126, 127, and 128.\
(d) In determining which socioeconomic program to use for an acquisition, the contracting officer should consider, at a minimum-\
(1) Results of market research that was done to determine if there are socioeconomic firms capable of satisfying the agency\'92s requirement; and\
(2) Agency progress in fulfilling its small business goals.\
(e) Small business set-asides have priority over acquisitions using full and open competition. See requirements for\

\fs20 19.301 Representations and rerepresentations.\
19.301-1 Representation by the offeror.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) To be eligible for award as a small business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3), an offeror is required to represent in good faith\'97\
(i) (A) That it meets the small business size standard corresponding to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code identified in the solicitation; or\
(B) For a multiple-award contract where there is more than one NAICS code assigned, that it meets the small business size standard for each distinct portion or category ( 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 line item numbers, Special Item Numbers (SINs), sectors, functional areas, or the equivalent) for which it submits an offer. If the small business concern submits an offer for the entire multiple-award contract, it must meet the size standard for each distinct portion or category ( 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 line item number, SIN, sector, functional area, or equivalent); and\
(ii) The Small Business Administration (SBA) has not issued a written determination stating otherwise pursuant to \cf3 13 CFR 121.1009\cf4 .\
(2) (i) A joint venture may qualify as a small business concern if the joint venture complies with the requirements of \cf3 13 CFR 121.103(h) \cf4 and \cf3 13 CFR 125.8(a) \cf4 and \cf3 (b) \cf4 and if\'97\
(A) Each party to the joint venture qualifies as small under the size standard for the solicitation; or\
(B) The prot\'e9g\'e9 is small under the size standard for the solicitation in a joint venture comprised of a mentor and prot\'e9g\'e9 with an approved mentor-prot\'e9g\'e9 agreement under an SBA mentor-prot\'e9g\'e9 program.\
(ii) A joint venture may qualify for an award under the socioeconomic programs as described in subparts \cf3 19.8\cf4 , \cf3 19.13\cf4 , \cf3 19.14\cf4 , and \cf3 19.15\cf4 .\
(b) An offeror is required to represent its size and socioeconomic status in writing to the contracting officer at the time of initial offer, (whether or not the offer includes price or the price is evaluated), including offers for\'97\
(1) Basic ordering agreements (see \cf3 16.703\cf4 ); and\
(2) Blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) issued pursuant to \cf3 part 13\cf4 .\
(c) To be eligible for an award of an order under a basic ordering agreement or a BPA issued pursuant to \cf3 part 13 \cf4 as a small\
business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3), the offeror must be a small business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) at the time of award of the order.\
(d) To be eligible for an award under the HUBZone Program (see \cf3 subpart 19.13\cf4 ), a HUBZone small business concern must be a HUBZone small business concern at the time of initial offer.\
(e) Multiple-award contract representations:\
(1) A business that represents as a small business concern at the time of its initial offer for the contract (whether or not\
the offer includes price or the price is evaluated (see \cf3 13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(iv)\cf4 ), is considered a small business concern for each order issued under the contract (but see \cf3 19.301-2 \cf4 for rerepresentations).\
(2) A business that represents as a small business concern at the time of its initial offer for a distinct portion or category as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) is considered a small business concern for each order issued under that distinct portion or category (but see \cf3 19.301-2 \cf4 for rerepresentations).\
(f) The contracting officer shall accept an offeror\'92s representation in a specific bid or proposal that it is a small business unless (1) another offeror or interested party challenges the concern\'92s small business representation or (2) the contracting officer has a reason to question the representation. Challenges of and questions concerning a specific representation shall be referred to the SBA in accordance with \cf3 19.302\cf4 .\
(g) An offeror\'92s representation that it is a small business is not binding on the SBA. If an offeror\'92s small business status is challenged, the SBA will evaluate the status of the concern and make a determination, which will be binding on the contracting officer, as to whether the offeror is a small business. A concern cannot become eligible for a specific award by taking action to meet the definition of a small business concern after the SBA has determined that it is not a small business.\
(h) If the SBA determines that the status of a concern as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business has been misrepresented in order to obtain a set-aside contract, an 8(a) subcontract, a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained in a subcontracting plan, or a prime or subcontract to be awarded as a result, or in furtherance of any other provision of Federal law that specifically references Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act for a definition of program eligibility, the SBA may take action as specified in Sections 16(a) or 16(d) of the Act. If the SBA declines to take\

\fs20 action, the agency may initiate the process. The SBA\'92s regulations on penalties for misrepresentations and false statements are contained in 13 CFR 121.108 for small business, 13 CFR 124.501 for 8(a) small business, 13 CFR 128.600 for veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 13 CFR 126.900 for HUBZone small business, and 13 CFR 127.700 for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concerns and women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.\

\f0\b 19.301-2 Rerepresentation by a contractor that represented itself as a small business concern.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Definition
\f1\i0 . As used in this subsection-\

\f2\i Long-term contract 
\f1\i0 means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at \cf3 52.217-8\cf4 , Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.\
(b) A contractor that represented itself as any of the small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) before contract award is required to rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status\'97\
(1) For the NAICS code(s) in the contract\'96\
(i) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract\
to include the clause at \cf3 52.219-28\cf4 , Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract;\
(ii) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition (whether the contractor acquires or is acquired by another company) of the contractor that does not require novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include the clause at \cf3 52.219-28\cf4 , Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract;\
(iii) For long-term contracts\'96\
(A) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and\
(B) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter; or\
(2) For the NAICS code assigned to an order under a multiple-award contract, if the contracting officer requires contractors to rerepresent their size and socioeconomic status for that order.\
(c) A contractor is required to rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of its rerepresentation that corresponds to the NAICS code that was initially assigned to the contract. For multiple-award contracts where there is more than one NAICS code assigned, the contractor is required to rerepresent its size status for each NAICS code assigned to the contract.\
(d) (1) 
\f2\i Contract rerepresentation. 
\f1\i0 After a contractor rerepresents for a contract that it no longer qualifies as a small business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) in accordance with \cf3 52.219-28\cf4 , the agency may no longer include the value of options exercised, modifications issued, orders issued, or purchases made under BPAs on that contract in its small business prime contracting goal achievements. When a contractor's rerepresentation for a contract qualifies it as a different small business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) than what it represented for award, the agency may include the value of options exercised, modifications issued, orders issued, or purchases made under BPAs on that contract in its small business prime contracting goal achievements, consistent with the rerepresentation. Agencies should issue a modification to the contract capturing the rerepresentation and report it to FPDS within 30 days after notification of the rerepresentation.\
(2) 
\f2\i Rerepresentation for a task or delivery order. 
\f1\i0 (i) When a contractor rerepresents for an order that it no longer qualifies as a small business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3), the agency cannot include the value of the order in its small business prime contracting goal achievements. When a contractor's rerepresentation for an order qualifies it as a different small business concern identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) than what it represented for contract award, the agency can include the value of the order in its small business prime contracting goal achievement, consistent with the rerepresentation.\
(ii) A rerepresentation for an order does not change the size or socioeconomic status representation for the contract. (e) A change in size status does not change the terms and conditions of the contract. However, the contracting officer may\
require a subcontracting plan for a contract containing \cf3 52.219-9\cf4 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, if a prime contractor's size status changes from small to other than small as a result of a size rerepresentation (see \cf3 19.705-2\cf4 (b)(3)).\

\f0\b 19.301-3 Rerepresentation by a contractor that represented itself as other than a small business concern.\

\f1\b0 A contractor that represented itself as other than small before contract award may, but is not required to, rerepresent its size status when-\
(a) The conditions in \cf3 19.301-2\cf4 (b) apply; and\

\f1\b0 (b) The contractor qualifies as a small business concern under the applicable size standard in effect at the time of its\
rerepresentation.\

\f0\b 19.302 Protesting a small business representation or rerepresentation.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The SBA regulations on small business size and size protests are found at \cf3 13 CFR part 121 \cf4 .\
(2) An offeror, the contracting officer, SBA, or another interested party may protest the small business representation\
of an offeror in a specific offer for a contract. However, for competitive 8(a) contracts, the filing of a protest is limited to an offeror, the contracting officer, or the SBA.\
(b) Any time after offers are received by the contracting officer, or in the case of bids, opened, the contracting officer may question the small business representation of any offeror in a specific offer by filing a contracting officer's protest (see paragraph (c) of this section).\
(c) (1) Any contracting officer who receives a protest, whether timely or not, or who, as the contracting officer, wishes to protest the small business representation of an offeror, or rerepresentation of a contractor, shall promptly forward the protest to the SBA Government Contracting Area Director at the Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located.\
(2) The protest, or confirmation if the protest was initiated orally, shall be in writing and shall contain the basis for the protest with specific, detailed evidence to support the allegation that the offeror is not small. The SBA will dismiss any protest that does not contain specific grounds for the protest.\
(3) The protest shall include a referral letter written by the contracting officer with information pertaining to the solicitation. The referral letter must include the following information to allow SBA to determine timeliness and standing:\
(i) The protest and any accompanying materials.\
(ii) A copy of the size self-certification.\
(iii) Identification of the applicable size standard.\
(iv) A copy or an electronic link to the solicitation and any amendments.\
(v) The name, address, telephone number, email address, and fax number of the contracting officer. (vi) Identification of the bid opening date or the date of notification provided to unsuccessful offerors. (vii) The date the contracting officer received the protest.\
(viii) A complete address and point of contact for the protested concern.\
(d) In order to affect a specific solicitation, a protest must be timely. SBA\'92s regulations on timeliness are contained in\
13 CFR121.1004. SBA\'92s regulations on timeliness related to protests of disadvantaged status are contained in 13 CFR124, Subpart B.\
(1) To be timely, a protest by any concern or other interested party must be received by the contracting officer (see paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section) by the close of business of the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions) or receipt of the special notification from the contracting officer that identifies the apparently successful offeror (in negotiated acquisitions) (see \cf3 15.503\cf4 (a)(2)).\
(i) A protest may be made orally if it is confirmed in writing and received by the contracting officer within the 5-day period or by letter postmarked no later than 1 business day after the oral protest.\
(ii) A protest may be made in writing if it is delivered to the contracting officer by hand, mail, facsimile, e-mail, express or overnight delivery service.\
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a protest filed by the contracting officer or SBA is always considered timely whether filed before or after award.\
(3) A protest under a Multiple Award Schedule will be timely if received by SBA at any time prior to the expiration of the contract period, including renewals.\
(4) A protest filed before bid opening, or notification to offerors of the selection of the apparent successful offeror, will be dismissed as premature by SBA.\
(e) Upon receipt of a protest from or forwarded by the Contracting Office, the SBA will-\
(1) Notify the contracting officer and the protester of the date it was received, and that the size of the concern being\
challenged is under consideration by the SBA; and\
(2) Furnish to the concern whose representation is being protested a copy of the protest and a blank SBA Form355,\
Application for Small Business Determination, by certified mail, return receipt requested.\
(f) (1) Within 15 business days after receipt of a protest or request for a formal size determination or within any extension\
of time granted by the contracting officer the SBA Area Office will determine the size status of the challenged concern. The\

\fs20 SBA Area Office will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the challenged concern of its decision by a verifiable means, which may include facsimile, electronic mail, or overnight delivery service.\
(2) Award may be made to a protested concern after the SBA Area Office has determined that either the protested concern is an eligible small business or has dismissed all protests against it.\
(3) If SBA\'92s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) subsequently overturns the Area Office's determination of eligibility or dismissal, and contract award has not been made, the contracting officer may apply the OHA decision to the procurement in question.\
(g) (1) After receiving a protest involving an offeror being considered for award, the contracting officer shall not award the contract until the SBA has made a size determination or 15 business days have expired since SBA\'92s receipt of a protest, whichever occurs first; however, award shall not be withheld when the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest.\
(2) If SBA has not made a determination within 15 business days, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may award the contract after determining in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.\
(3) SBA may, at its sole discretion, reopen a formal size determination to correct an error or mistake, if it is within the appeal period and no appeal has been filed with OHA or, a final decision has not been rendered by the SBA Area Office or OHA.\
(4) If a protest is received that challenges the small business status of an offeror not being considered for award, the contracting officer is not required to suspend contract action. The contracting officer shall forward the protest to the SBA (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) with a notation that the concern is not being considered for award, and shall notify the protester of this action.\
(h) An appeal from an SBA size determination may be filed by any concern or other interested party whose protest of\
the small business representation of another concern has been denied by an SBA Government Contracting Area Director,\
any concern or other interested party that has been adversely affected by an SBA Government Contracting Area Director\'92s decision, or the SBA Associate Administrator for the SBA program involved. The appeal must be filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Small Business Administration, Suite 5900, 409 3 rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416, within the time limits and in strict accordance with the procedures contained in Subpart C of 13 CFR 134. It is within the discretion\
of the SBA Judge whether to accept an appeal from a size determination. If a post-award appeal is submitted to OHA\
within the time limits specified in Subpart C of 13 CFR 134, the contracting officer shall consider suspending contract performance until an SBA Judge decides the appeal. SBA will inform the contracting officer of its ruling on the appeal. SBA\'92s decision, if received before award, will apply to the pending acquisition. If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (g)(1) or (2) of this section, the contract has been awarded, the SBA rulings is received after award, and OHA finds the protested concern to be ineligible for award, the contracting officer shall terminate the contract unless termination is not in the best interests of the Government, in keeping with the circumstances described in the written determination. However, the contracting officer shall not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders.\
(i) SBA will dismiss untimely protests. A protest that is not timely, even though received before award, shall be forwarded to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section), with a notation on it that the protest\
is not timely. A protest received by a contracting officer after award of a contract shall be forwarded to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office with a notation that award has been made.\
(j) When a concern is found to be other than small under a protest concerning a size status rerepresentation made in accordance with the clause at \cf3 52.219-28\cf4 , Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, a contracting officer may permit contract performance to continue, issue orders, or exercise option(s), because the contract remains a valid contract.\

\f0\b 19.303 [Reserved].\
19.304 Small disadvantaged business status.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer may accept an offeror\'92s representation that it is a small disadvantaged business concern (SDB) concern.\
(b) The provision at \cf3 52.219-1\cf4 , Small Business Program Representations, or \cf3 52.212-3\cf4 (c)(5), Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, is used to collect SDB data.\
(c) A representation of SDB status on a Federal prime contract will be deemed a misrepresentation of SDB status if the firm does not meet the requirements of 13 CFR 124.1001.\

\f1\b0 (d) Any person or entity that misrepresents a firm's status as an SDB concern in order to obtain a contracting opportunity in accordance with section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, ( \cf3 15 U.S.C. 637(d)\cf4 ) will be subject to the penalties imposed by section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, (\cf3 15 U.S.C. 645(d)\cf4 ), as well as any other penalty authorized by law.\

\f0\b 19.305 Reviews of SDB status.\

\f1\b0 This section applies to reviews of a small business concern's SDB status as a prime contractor or subcontractor.\
(a) SBA may initiate the review of SDB status on any firm that has represented itself to be an SDB on a prime contract or subcontract to a Federal prime contract whenever it receives credible information calling into question the SDB status of the firm.\
(b) Requests for an SBA review of SDB status may be forwarded to the Small Business Administration, \cf2 Associate Administrator for Business Development (AA/BD), 409 Third Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.\
(c) An SBA review of a subcontractor's SDB status differs from a formal protest. Protests of a concern's size as a prime contractor are processed under \cf3 19.302\cf4 . Protests of a concern's size as a subcontractor are processed under \cf3 19.703\cf4 (b).\

\f0\b 19.306 Protesting a firm\'92s status as a HUBZone small business concern.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Definition
\f1\i0 . As used in this section-\

\f2\i Interested party 
\f1\i0 has the meaning given in 13 CFR 126.103.\
(b) (1) For sole-source procurements, SBA or the contracting officer may protest the prospective contractor's certified\
HUBZone status; for all other procurements, SBA, the contracting officer, or any other interested party may protest the apparent successful offeror's certified HUBZone status (see \cf3 13 CFR 126.800\cf4 ).\
(2) The Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program will determine whether the concern has certified HUBZone status. If SBA upholds the protest, SBA will remove the concern's HUBZone status in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS). SBA's protest regulations are found in subpart H \'93Protests\'94 at \cf3 13 CFR 126.800 \cf4 through \cf3 126.805\cf4 .\
(c) Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of \cf3 19.302\cf4 . An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests. Protests relating to small business size status for the acquisition and the HUBZone eligibility requirements will be processed concurrently by SBA.\
(d) (1) All protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest ( 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 why the protested concern did not meet the eligibility requirements at \cf3 13 CFR 126.200 \cf4 at the time of the concern's application to SBA for certification as a HUBZone small business concern or at the time SBA certified or last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern). Assertions that a protested concern is not a HUBZone small business concern, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by SBA (see \cf3 13 CFR 126.801(b)\cf4 ).\
(2) Protests filed against a HUBZone joint venture must state one or, if applicable, both of the following:\
(i) Why the HUBZone small business party to the joint venture did not meet the eligibility requirements at \cf3 13 CFR 126.200 \cf4 at the time of its application to SBA for certification or at the time SBA certified or last recertified the concern as a\
HUBZone small business concern.\
(ii) Why the joint venture did not meet the requirements at \cf3 13 CFR 126.616 \cf4 at the time of submission of its offer for\
a HUBZone contract.\
(e) 
\f2\i Submission of a protest. 
\f1\i0 (1) An interested party shall submit its written protest to the contracting officer-\
(i) For sealed bids-\
(A) By the close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening; or\
(B) By the close of business on the fifth business day from the date of identification of the apparent successful\
offeror, if the price evaluation preference was not applied at the time of bid opening; or\
(ii) For negotiated acquisitions, by the close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting\
officer of the apparently successful offeror.\
(2) Any protest received after the designated time limits is untimely, unless it is from the contracting officer or SBA. (3) SBA will consider protests for HUBZone set-aside or sole-source service contracts or orders, if a HUBZone prime\
contractor is unduly reliant on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in \cf3 13 CFR 125.1\cf4 , or if such subcontractor performs the primary and vital requirements of the contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at \cf3 19.302\cf4 , and \cf3 13 CFR 121.103(h)(2)\cf4 , which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the \'93ostensible subcontractor rule\'94).\
(f) The contracting officer shall forward all protests with a referral letter to the Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program, by email to 
\f2\i \cf3 hzprotests@sba.gov\cf4 . 
\f1\i0 The referral letter shall include the following\'97\

evaluation preference, or reserve for HUBZone small business concerns under a multiple-award contract);\
(4) For a procurement conducted using full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference,\
whether the protester's opportunity for award was affected by the preference;\
(5) For a HUBZone set-aside, whether the protester submitted an offer;\
(6) Whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror;\

(g) SBA will notify the protester and the contracting officer of the date SBA received the protest.\
(h) Before SBA decision. (1) After receiving a protest involving the apparent successful offeror\'92s status as a HUBZone small business concern, the contracting officer shall either-\
(i) Withhold award of the contract until SBA determines the status of the protested concern; or (ii) Award the contract if\'97\
(A) SBA does not issue its decision within 15 business days after receipt of the protest; and\
(B) The contracting officer determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting for SBA's determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.\
(2) SBA will determine the merits of the status protest within 15 business days after receipt of a protest, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer.\
(i) After SBA decision. The SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of the SBA determination.

\fs20 19.401 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Small Business Act is the authority under which the Small Business Administration (SBA) and agencies consult and cooperate with each other in formulating policies to ensure that small business interests will be recognized and protected.\
(b) The Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization serves as the agency focal point for interfacing with SBA. The Director of the Office of Small Business Programs is the agency focal point for the Department of Defense.\

\f0\b 19.402 Small Business Administration procurement center representatives.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The SBA may assign one or more procurement center representatives (PCRs) to any contracting activity or contract administration office to carry out SBA policies and programs. Assigned SBA PCRs are required to comply with the contracting agency's directives governing the conduct of contracting personnel and the release of contract information. The SBA must obtain for its PCRs security clearances required by the contracting agency.\
(2) If an SBA PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity or contract administration office, contact the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the procuring activity is located for assistance in carrying out SBA policies and programs. See \cf3 https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/counseling-help/procurement-center-representative- directory \cf4 for the location of the SBA office servicing the activity.\
(b) Upon their request and subject to applicable acquisition and security regulations, contracting officers shall give SBA PCRs (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see paragraph (a) of this section) access to all reasonably obtainable contract information that is directly pertinent to their official duties.\
(c) The duties assigned by SBA to its PCR are set forth at \cf3 13 CFR 125.2\cf4 (b) and include but are not limited to the following:\
(1) Reviewing proposed acquisitions to recommend\'96\
(i) The set-aside or sole-source award to a small business of selected acquisitions;\
(ii) New qualified small business sources, including veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small,\
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged women-owned small, and women-owned small eligible under the Women-Owned Small Business Program;\
(iii) Breakout of discrete components, items, and requirements for competitive acquisitions; and\
(iv) Ways to improve competition.\
(2) Reviewing proposed acquisition packages provided in accordance with \cf3 19.202-1\cf4 (e). If the SBA procurement center\
representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see paragraph (a) of this section) believes that the acquisition, as proposed, makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract, the representative shall recommend any alternate contracting method that the representative reasonably believes will increase small business prime contracting opportunities. The recommendation shall be made to the contracting officer within 15 days after receipt of the package.\

\fs24 Subpart 19.5 - Small Business Total Set-Asides, Partial Set-Asides, and Reserves\

\fs20 19.501 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The purpose of small business set-asides is to award certain acquisitions exclusively to small business concerns. A "set-aside for small business" is the limiting of an acquisition exclusively for participation by small business concerns. A small business set-aside may be open to any of the small business concerns identified at \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3). A small business set- aside of a single acquisition or a class of acquisitions may be total or partial.\
(2) The purpose of small business reserves is to award one or more multiple-award contracts to any of the small business concerns identified at \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3), under a full and open competition. A small business reserve shall not be used when the acquisition can be set aside, in total or in part.\
(b) The contracting officer makes the determination to make a small business set-aside, in total or in part, or a reserve. The Small Business Administration (SBA) procurement center representative (PCR) (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) may make a recommendation to the contracting officer.\
(c) The contracting officer shall review acquisitions to determine if they can be set aside, in total or in part, or reserved for small business, giving consideration to the recommendations of agency personnel in the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, or for the Department of Defense, in the Office of Small Business Programs. Agencies may establish threshold levels for this review depending upon their needs.\
(d) At the request of an SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)), the contracting officer shall make available for review at the contracting office (to the extent of the SBA representative's security clearance) any proposed acquisition in excess of the micro-purchase threshold.\
(e) All solicitations involving set-asides, in total or in part, or reserves shall specify the NAICS code(s) and corresponding size standard(s) (see \cf3 19.102\cf4 ).\
(f) Except as authorized by law, a contract may not be awarded as a result of a small business set-aside if the cost to the awarding agency exceeds the fair market price.\
(g) For the applicability of the limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule, see \cf3 19.505\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.502 Setting aside acquisitions.\
19.502-1 Requirements for setting aside acquisitions.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall set aside an individual acquisition or class of acquisitions for competition among small businesses when-\
(1) It is determined to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation\'92s full productive capacity, war or national defense programs; or\
(2) Assuring that a fair proportion of Government contracts in each industry is placed with small business concerns; and the circumstances described in \cf3 19.502-2 \cf4 or \cf3 19.502-3\cf4 (a) exist.\
(b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold, or purchases from required sources under \cf3 part 8\cf4 (e.g., Committee for Purchase From People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled).\

\f0\b 19.502-2 Total small business set-asides.\

\f1\b0 (a) Before setting aside an acquisition under this paragraph, refer to \cf3 19.203\cf4 (b). Each acquisition of supplies or services that has an anticipated dollar value above the micro-purchase threshold, but not over the simplified acquisition threshold, shall\
be set aside for small business unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery. If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer from a responsible small business concern in response\
to a set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that firm. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, shall be resolicited on an unrestricted basis. The small business set-aside does not preclude the award of a contract as described in \cf3 19.203\cf4 .\
(b) Before setting aside an acquisition under this paragraph, refer to \cf3 19.203\cf4 (c). The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition over the simplified acquisition threshold for small business participation when there is a reasonable expectation that-\
(1) Offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns; and\

\fs20 (2) Award will be made at fair market prices. Total small business set-asides shall not be made unless such a reasonable expectation exists (see \cf3 19.502-3 \cf4 for partial set-asides). Although past acquisition history and market research of an item\
or similar items are always important, these are not the only factors to be considered in determining whether a reasonable expectation exists. In making research and development small business set-asides, there must also be a reasonable expectation of obtaining from small businesses the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules.\

\f0\b 19.502-3 Partial set-asides of contracts other than multiple-award contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall set aside a portion or portions of an acquisition, except for construction, for exclusive small business participation when\'97\
(1) Market research indicates that a total set-aside is not appropriate (see \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 );\
(2) The requirement can be divided into distinct portions;\
(3) The acquisition is not subject to simplified acquisition procedures;\
(4) Two or more responsible small business concerns are reasonably expected to submit offers on the set-aside portion\
or portions of the acquisition that are competitive in terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery;\
(5) The specific program eligibility requirements identified in this part apply; and\
(6) The solicitation will result in a contract other than a multiple-award contract (see \cf3 2.101 \cf4 for definition of multiple-\
award contract).\
(b) When the contracting officer determines that a requirement is to be partially set aside, the solicitation shall identify\
which portion or portions are set aside and not set aside.\
(c) The contracting officer shall specify in the solicitation how offers shall be submitted with regard to the set-aside and\
non-set-aside portions.\
(d) Offers received from concerns that do not qualify as small business concerns shall be considered nonresponsive and\
shall be rejected on the set-aside portion of partial set-asides. However, before rejecting an offer otherwise eligible for award because of questions concerning the size representation, an SBA determination must be obtained (see \cf3 subpart 19.3\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 19.502-4 Partial set-asides of multiple-award contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) In accordance with section 1331 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 ( \cf3 15 U.S.C. 644\cf4 (r)(1)), contracting officers may, at their discretion, set aside a portion or portions of a multiple-award contract, except for construction, for any of the small business concerns identified at \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3) when\'97\
(1) Market research indicates that a total set-aside is not appropriate (see \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 );\
(2) The requirement can be divided into distinct portions;\
(3) The acquisition is not subject to simplified acquisition procedures;\
(4) Two or more responsible small business concerns are reasonably expected to submit an offer on the set-aside\
portion or portions of the acquisition that are competitive in terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery; and (5) The specific program eligibility requirements identified in this part apply.\
(b) When the contracting officer determines that a requirement is to be partially set aside, the solicitation shall identify which portion or portions are set aside and not set aside.\
(c) The contracting officer shall specify in the solicitation how offers shall be submitted with regard to the set-aside and non-set-aside portions.\
(d) Offers received from concerns that do not qualify as small business concerns shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected on the set-aside portion of partial set-asides. However, before rejecting an offer otherwise eligible for award because of questions concerning the size representation, an SBA determination must be obtained (see \cf3 subpart 19.3\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 19.502-5 Insufficient reasons for not setting aside an acquisition.\

\f1\b0 None of the following is, in itself, sufficient cause for not setting aside an acquisition:\
(a) A large percentage of previous contracts for the required item(s) has been placed with small business concerns.\
(b) The item is on an established planning list under the Industrial Readiness Planning Program. However, a total small\
business set-aside shall not be made when the list contains a large business Planned Emergency Producer of the item(s) who has conveyed a desire to supply some or all of the required items.\
(c) The item is on a Qualified Products List. However, a total small business set-aside shall not be made if the list contains the products of large businesses unless none of the large businesses desire to participate in the acquisition.\

\f1\b0 (d) A period of less than 30 days is available for receipt of offers.\
(e) The acquisition is classified.\
(f) Small business concerns are already receiving a fair proportion of the agency\'92s contracts for supplies and services. (g) A class small business set-aside of the item or service has been made by another contracting activity.\
(h) A "brand name or equal" product description will be used in the solicitation.\

\f0\b 19.502-6 Setting aside a class of acquisitions for small business.\

\f1\b0 (a) A class of acquisitions of selected products or services, or a portion of the acquisitions, may be set aside for exclusive participation by small business concerns if individual acquisitions in the class will meet the criteria in \cf3 19.502-1\cf4 , \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 , or \cf3 19.502-3\cf4 (a). The determination to make a class small business set-aside shall not depend on the existence of a current acquisition if future acquisitions can be clearly foreseen.\
(b) The determination to set aside a class of acquisitions for small business may be either unilateral or joint. (c) Each class small business set-aside determination shall be in writing and must-\
(1) Specifically identify the product(s) and service(s) it covers;\
(2) Provide that the set-aside does not apply to any acquisition automatically set aside under \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 (a).\
(3) Provide that the set-aside applies only to the (named) contracting office(s) making the determination; and\
(4) Provide that the set-aside does not apply to any individual acquisition if the requirement is not severable into two or\
more economic production runs or reasonable lots, in the case of a partial class set-aside.\
(d) The contracting officer shall review each individual acquisition arising under a class small business set-aside to\
identify any changes in the magnitude of requirements, specifications, delivery requirements, or competitive market conditions that have occurred since the initial approval of the class set-aside. If there are any changes of such a material nature as to result in probable payment of more than a fair market price by the Government or in a change in the capability of small business concerns to satisfy the requirements, the contracting officer may withdraw or modify (see \cf3 19.502-9\cf4 (a)) the unilateral or joint set-aside by giving written notice to the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) stating the reasons.\

\f0\b 19.502-7 Inclusion of Federal Prison Industries, Inc.\

\f1\b0 When using competitive procedures in accordance with \cf3 8.602\cf4 (a)(4), agencies shall include Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), in the solicitation process and consider a timely offer from FPI.\

\f0\b 19.502-8 Rejecting Small Business Administration recommendations.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the contracting officer rejects a recommendation of the SBA, written notice shall be furnished to the appropriate SBA representative within 5 working days of the contracting officer's receipt of the recommendation.\
(b) The SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) may appeal the contracting officer's rejection to the head of the contracting activity within 2 working days after receiving the notice (except see \cf3 19.1305\cf4 (d), \cf3 19.1405\cf4 (e), and \cf3 19.1505\cf4 (i)). The head of the contracting activity shall render a decision in writing, and provide it to the SBA representative within 7 working days. Pending issuance of a decision to the SBA representative, the contracting officer shall suspend action on the acquisition.\
(c) If the head of the contracting activity agrees that the contracting officer\'92s rejection was appropriate-\
(1) Within 2 working days, the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) may request the contracting officer to suspend action on the acquisition until the SBA Administrator\
appeals to the agency head (see paragraph (f) of this section); and\
(2) The SBA must be allowed 15 working days after making such a written request, within which the Administrator of\
SBA\'96\
(i) May appeal to the Secretary of the Department concerned; and\
(ii) Must notify the contracting officer whether the further appeal has, in fact, been taken. If notification is not\
received by the contracting officer within the 15-day period, it is deemed that the SBA request to suspend the contract action has been withdrawn and that an appeal to the Secretary was not taken.\
(d) When the contracting officer has been notified within the 15-day period that the SBA has appealed to the agency head, the head of the contracting activity (or designee) shall forward justification for its decision to the agency head. The contracting officer shall suspend contract action until notification is received that the SBA appeal has been settled.\
(e) The agency head shall reply to the SBA within 30 working days after receiving the appeal. The decision of the agency head shall be final.\

\fs20 (f) A request to suspend action on an acquisition need not be honored if the contracting officer determines that proceeding to contract award and performance is in the public interest. The contracting officer shall include in the contract file a statement of the facts justifying the determination, and shall promptly notify the SBA representative of the determination and provide a copy of the justification.\

\f0\b 19.502-9 Withdrawing or modifying small business set-asides.\

\f1\b0 (a) If, before award of a contract involving a total or partial small business set-aside, the contracting officer considers that award would be detrimental to the public interest (e.g., payment of more than a fair market price), the contracting officer may withdraw the small business set-aside, whether it was unilateral or joint. The contracting officer shall initiate a withdrawal of an individual total or partial small business set-aside, by giving written notice to the agency small business specialist and the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) stating the reasons. In a similar manner, the contracting officer may modify a unilateral or joint class small business set-aside to withdraw one or more individual acquisitions.\
(b) If the agency small business specialist does not agree to a withdrawal or modification, the case shall be promptly referred to the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) for review.\
(c) The contracting officer shall prepare a written statement supporting any withdrawal or modification of a small business set-aside and include it in the contract file.\

\f0\b 19.502-10 Automatic dissolution of a small business set-aside.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a small business set-aside acquisition or portion of an acquisition is not awarded, the unilateral or joint determination to set the acquisition aside is automatically dissolved for the unawarded portion of the set-aside. The required supplies and/or services for which no award was made may be acquired by sealed bidding or negotiation, as appropriate.\
(b) Before issuing a solicitation for the items called for in a small business set-aside that was dissolved, the contracting officer shall ensure that the delivery schedule is realistic in the light of all relevant factors, including the capabilities of small business concerns.\

\f0\b 19.502-11 Solicitation notice regarding administration of change orders for construction.\

\f1\b0 See \cf3 36.211 \cf4 for the requirement to provide a notice to offerors regarding definitization of equitable adjustments for change orders under construction contracts.\

\f0\b 19.503 Reserves.\

(1) A total set-aside is not feasible because there is no reasonable expectation of receiving offers that are competitive in terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery from at least two responsible small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a) (3), that can perform the entire requirement; and\
(2) A partial set-aside is not feasible because\'97\
(i) The contracting officer is unable to divide the requirement into distinct portions; or\
(ii) There is no reasonable expectation that at least two responsible small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)\
(3) can perform any portion of the requirement competitively in terms of fair market price, quality, and delivery. (b) A reserve will result in one of the following:\
(1) One or more contract awards to any one or more types of small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3).\
(2) In the case of a solicitation of a bundled requirement that will result in a multiple-award contract, an award to one or more small businesses with a Small Business Teaming Arrangement.\
(c) The specific program eligibility requirements identified in this part apply.\
(d) The limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule (see \cf3 19.505\cf4 ) do not apply to reserves at the contract level, but shall apply to orders that are set aside or issued directly to one small business concern under \cf3 19.504\cf4 (c)(1)(ii).\

\f0\b 19.504 Orders under multiple-award contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General. 
\f1\i0 In accordance with section 1331 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 ( \cf3 15 U.S.C. 644\cf4 (r)(2)), contracting officers may, at their discretion, set aside orders placed under multiple-award contracts for any of the small business concerns identified in \cf3 19.000\cf4 (a)(3).\

(ii) At least 50 percent of the total cost of the components of the kit shall be manufactured, processed, or produced in\
the United States or its outlying areas by business concerns that are small under the size standards for the NAICS codes of the components of the kit.\
(3) 
\f2\i Identification of manufacturers
\f1\i0 . For the purposes of applying the nonmanufacturer rule, the manufacturer, processor, or producer is the concern that manufactures, processes, or produces an end item with its own facilities (i.e., transforms raw materials, miscellaneous parts, or components into the end item being acquired). See \cf3 13 CFR 121.406\cf4 (b)(2).\
(4) 
\f2\i Waiver of nonmanufacturer rule. 
\f1\i0 (i) The SBA may grant an individual or a class waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule to allow a nonmanufacturer to provide an end item of an other than small business without regard to the place of manufacture, processing, or production.\
(A) 
\f2\i Class waiver. 
\f1\i0 An agency may request that SBA waive the requirement at paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section for a specific product or class of products. See \cf3 13 CFR 121.1202 \cf4 for an explanation of when SBA will issue a class waiver.\
(B) 
\f2\i Individual waiver. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer may also request a waiver of the requirements at paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section for an individual acquisition once the contracting officer determines through market research that no known small business manufacturers, processors, or producers in the United States or its outlying areas can reasonably\
be expected to offer an end item meeting the requirements of the solicitation. This type of waiver is known as an individual waiver and would apply only to a specific acquisition.\
(ii) 
\f2\i Waiver requests. 
\f1\i0 Requests for waivers shall include the content specified at \cf3 13 CFR 121.1204 \cf4 and shall be sent via email to \cf3 nmrwaivers@sba.gov \cf4 or by mail to the\'97Director, Office of Government Contracting, Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416.\

\f1\b0 (iv) 
\f2\i Notification of waiver. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer shall provide potential offerors with written notification of any class or individual waiver in the solicitation. If providing the notification after solicitation issuance, the contracting officer shall provide potential offerors a reasonable amount of additional time to respond to the solicitation.\
(5) 
\f2\i Multiple-item acquisitions. 
\f1\i0 (i) If at least 50 percent of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured, processed, or produced by small business concerns, then a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule is not required. There is no requirement that each item acquired in a multiple-item acquisition be manufactured, processed, or produced by a small business in the United States or its outlying areas.\
(ii) If more than 50 percent of the estimated acquisition cost is composed of items manufactured, processed, or produced by other than small business concerns, then a waiver is required. SBA may grant an individual waiver for one or more items in an acquisition in order to ensure that at least 50 percent of the cost of the items to be supplied by the nonmanufacturer comes from small business manufacturers, processors, and producers in the United States or its outlying areas or are subject to a waiver.\
(iii) If a small business offeror is both a manufacturer of item(s) and a nonmanufacturer of other item(s) for an acquisition, the contracting officer shall apply the manufacturer size standard.\

\f0\b 19.506 Documentation requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The contracting officer shall document the rationale when a contract is not totally set aside for small business in accordance with \cf3 19.502-2\cf4 .\

\fs24 Subpart 19.6 - Certificates of Competency and Determinations of Responsibility\

\fs20 19.601 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) A Certificate of Competency (COC) is the certificate issued by the Small Business Administration (SBA) stating that the holder is responsible (with respect to all elements of responsibility, including, but not limited to, capability, competency, capacity, credit, integrity, perseverance, tenacity, and limitations on subcontracting) for the purpose of receiving and performing a specific Government contract.\
(b) The COC program empowers the SBA to certify to Government contracting officers as to all elements of responsibility of any small business concern to receive and perform a specific Government contract. The COC program does not extend to questions concerning regulatory requirements imposed and enforced by other Federal agencies.\
(c) The COC program is applicable to all Government acquisitions except for 8(a) sole-source awards. A contracting officer shall, upon determining an apparent successful small business offeror to be nonresponsible, refer that small business to the SBA for a possible COC, even if the next acceptable offer is from a small business.\
(d) When a solicitation requires a small business to adhere to the limitations on subcontracting, a contracting officer\'92s finding that a small business cannot comply with the limitation shall be treated as an element of responsibility and shall be subject to the COC process. When a solicitation requires a small business to adhere to the definition of a nonmanufacturer, a contracting officer\'92s determination that the small business does not comply shall be processed in accordance with \cf3 subpart 19.3\cf4 .\
(e) Contracting officers, including those located overseas, are required to comply with this subpart for U.S. small business concerns.\
(f) For the purpose of receiving a COC on an unrestricted acquisition, a small business nonmanufacturer may furnish any end item produced or manufactured in the United States or its outlying areas.\

\f0\b 19.602 Procedures.\
19.602-1 Referral.\

\f1\b0 (a) Upon determining and documenting that an apparent successful small business offeror lacks certain elements of responsibility (including, but not limited to, capability, competency, capacity, credit, integrity, perseverance, tenacity, and limitations on subcontracting, but for sureties see \cf3 28.101-3\cf4 (f) and \cf3 28.203-1\cf4 (e)), the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Withhold contract award (see \cf3 19.602-3\cf4 ); and\
(2) Refer the matter to the cognizant SBA Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serving the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located, in accordance with agency procedures, except that referral is not necessary if the small business concern-\
(i) Is determined to be unqualified and ineligible because it does not meet the standard in \cf3 9.104-1\cf4 (g), provided, that the determination is approved by the chief of the contracting office; or\
(ii) Is suspended or debarred under Executive Order 11246 or \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 .\
(b) If a partial set-aside is involved, the contracting officer shall refer to the SBA the entire quantity to which the concern\
may be entitled, if responsible. (c) The referral shall include-\
(1) A notice that a small business concern has been determined to be nonresponsible, specifying the elements of responsibility the contracting officer found lacking; and\
(2) If applicable, a copy of the following:\
(i) Solicitation.\
(ii) Final offer submitted by the concern whose responsibility is at issue for the procurement.\
(iii) Abstract of bids or the contracting officer\'92s price negotiation memorandum.\
(iv) Preaward survey.\
(v) Technical data package (including drawings, specifications and statement of work).\
(vi) Any other justification and documentation used to arrive at the nonresponsibility determination.\
(d) For any single acquisition, the contracting officer shall make only one referral at a time regarding a determination of nonresponsibility.\
(e) Contract award shall be withheld by the contracting officer for a period of 15 business days (or longer if agreed to by the SBA and the contracting officer) following receipt by the appropriate SBA Area Office of a referral that includes all required documentation.\

\f0\b\fs20 19.602-2 Issuing or denying a Certificate of Competency (COC).\

\f1\b0 Within 15 business days (or a longer period agreed to by the SBA and the contracting agency) after receiving a notice that a small business concern lacks certain elements of responsibility, the SBA Area Office will take the following actions:\
(a) Inform the small business concern of the contracting officer\'92s determination and offer it an opportunity to apply to the SBA for a COC. (A concern wishing to apply for a COC should notify the SBA Area Office serving the geographical area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located.)\
(b) Upon timely receipt of a complete and acceptable application, elect to visit the applicant\'92s facility to review its responsibility.\
(1) The COC review process is not limited to the areas of nonresponsibility cited by the contracting officer.\
(2) The SBA may, at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC applicant for all elements of responsibility, but may presume responsibility exists as to elements other than those cited as deficient.\
(c) Consider denying a COC for reasons of nonresponsibility not originally cited by the contracting officer.\
(d) When the Area Director determines that a COC is warranted (for contracts valued at $25,000,000 or less), notify the contracting officer and provide the following options:\
(1) Accept the Area Director\'92s decision to issue a COC and award the contract to the concern. The COC issuance letter will then be sent, including as an attachment a detailed rationale for the decision; or\
(2) Ask the Area Director to suspend the case for one or more of the following purposes:\
(i) To permit the SBA to forward a detailed rationale for the decision to the contracting officer for review within a\
specified period of time.\
(ii) To afford the contracting officer the opportunity to meet with the Area Office to review all documentation\
contained in the case file and to attempt to resolve any issues.\
(iii) To submit any information to the SBA Area Office that the contracting officer believes the SBA did not\
consider (at which time, the SBA Area Office will establish a new suspense date mutually agreeable to the contracting officer and the SBA).\
(iv) To permit resolution of an appeal by the contracting agency to SBA Headquarters under \cf3 19.602-3\cf4 . However, there is no contracting officer\'92s appeal when the Area Office proposes to issue a COC valued at $100,000 or less.\
(e) At the completion of the process, notify the concern and the contracting officer that the COC is denied or is being issued.\
(f) Refer recommendations for issuing a COC on contracts greater than $25,000,000 to SBA Headquarters.\

\f0\b 19.602-3 Resolving differences between the agency and the Small Business Administration.\

\f1\b0 (a) COCs valued between $100,000 and $25,000,000. (1) When disagreements arise about a concern\'92s ability to perform, the contracting officer and the SBA shall make every effort to reach a resolution before the SBA takes final action on a COC. This shall be done through the complete exchange of information and in accordance with agency procedures. If agreement cannot be reached between the contracting officer and the SBA Area Office, the contracting officer shall request that the Area Office suspend action and refer the matter to SBA Headquarters for review. The SBA Area Office shall honor the request for a review if the contracting officer agrees to withhold award until the review process is concluded. Without an agreement to withhold award, the SBA Area Office will issue the COC in accordance with applicable SBA regulations.\
(2) SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the procuring agency\'92s Director of the, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) or, for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs, or other designated official (with a copy to the contracting officer) that the case file has been received and that an appeal decision may be requested by an authorized official.\
(3) If the contracting agency decides to file an appeal, it must notify SBA Headquarters through its procuring agency\'92s Director, OSDBU, or other designated official, within 10 business days (or a time period agreed upon by both agencies) that it intends to appeal the issuance of the COC.\
(4) The appeal and any supporting documentation shall be filed by the procuring agency\'92s Director, OSDBU, or other designated official, within 10 business days (or a period agreed upon by both agencies) after SBA Headquarters receives the agency\'92s notification in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection.\
(5) The SBA Associate Administrator for Government Contracting will make a final determination, in writing, to issue or to deny the COC.\
(b) SBA Headquarters\'92 decisions on COCs valued over $25,000,000. (1) Prior to taking final action, SBA Headquarters will contact the contracting agency and offer it the following options:\

\f1\b0 (i) To request that the SBA suspend case processing to allow the agency to meet with SBA Headquarters personnel and review all documentation contained in the case file; or\
(ii) To submit to SBA Headquarters for evaluation any information that the contracting agency believes has not been considered.\
(2) After reviewing all available information, the SBA will make a final decision to either issue or deny the COC.\
(c) Reconsideration of a COC after issuance. (1) The SBA reserves the right to reconsider its issuance of a COC, prior to\
contract award, if-\
(i) The COC applicant submitted false information or omitted materially adverse information; or\
(ii) The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case the SBA may investigate the firm\'92s current\
circumstances).\
(2) When the SBA reconsiders and reaffirms the COC, the procedures in subsection \cf3 19.602-2 \cf4 do not apply.\
(3) Denial of a COC by the SBA does not preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred\
concern, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other procurement.\

\f0\b 19.602-4 Awarding the contract.\

\f1\b0 (a) If new information causes the contracting officer to determine that the concern referred to the SBA is actually responsible to perform the contract, and award has not already been made under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall reverse the determination of nonresponsibility, notify the SBA of this action, withdraw the referral, and proceed to award the contract.\
(b) The contracting officer shall award the contract to the concern in question if the SBA issues a COC after receiving the referral. An SBA-certified concern shall not be required to meet any other requirements of responsibility. SBA COC\'92s are conclusive with respect to all elements of responsibility of prospective small business contractors. Where SBA issues a COC, the contracting officer may decide not to award to that offeror for reasons unrelated to responsibility.\
(c) The contracting officer shall proceed with the acquisition and award the contract to another appropriately selected and responsible offeror if the SBA has not issued a COC within 15 business days (or a longer period of time agreed to with the SBA) after receiving the referral.\

(ii) For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, the modification referenced in paragraph (a)(1) (iii) of this section shall require the contractor to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan for either the distinct portion(s) or category(ies) of the contract for which the contractor is other than small or for the entirety of their contract, at the contractor's discretion. When determining the need for a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall consider the cumulative dollar value of the portion(s) or category(ies) of the contract for which the contractor is other than small.\
(b) Subcontracting plans (see paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section) are not required\'96\
(1) From small business concerns;\
(2) For personal services contracts;\
(3) For contracts or contract modifications that will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying\
areas; or\
(4) For modifications that are within the scope of the contract and the contract does not contain the clause at \cf3 52.219-8\cf4 ,\
Utilization of Small Business Concerns.\
(c) As stated in \cf3 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(9)\cf4 , any contractor or subcontractor failing to comply in good faith with the requirements\
of the subcontracting plan is in material breach of its contract. Further, \cf3 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) \cf4 directs that a contractor\'92s failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages.\
(d) As authorized by \cf3 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(12)\cf4 , certain costs incurred by a mentor firm in providing developmental assistance to a prot\'e9g\'e9 firm under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor-Prot\'e9g\'e9 Program, may be credited as if they were subcontract awards to a prot\'e9g\'e9 firm for the purpose of determining whether the mentor firm attains the applicable goals under any subcontracting plan entered into with any executive agency. However, the mentor-prot\'e9g\'e9 agreement must have been approved by the Director, Small Business Programs of the cognizant DoD military department or defense agency, before developmental assistance costs may be credited against subcontract goals. A list of approved agreements may be obtained at \cf3 https://business.defense.gov/Programs/Mentor-Protege-Program/.\

\f0\b \cf4 19.703 Eligibility requirements for participating in the program.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, to be eligible as a subcontractor under the program, a concern must represent itself as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern.\
(1) To represent itself as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern, a concern\
must meet the appropriate definition (see \cf3 2.101 \cf4 and \cf3 19.001\cf4 ). For subcontracting purposes, a concern is small if it does not exceed the size standard for the NAICS code that the prime contractor determines best describes the product or service being acquired by the subcontract.\
(2) (i) The prime contractor may accept a subcontractor's written representations of its size and socioeconomic status as a small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or a women-owned small business, if the subcontractor represents that the size and socioeconomic status representation with its offer are current, accurate, and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontracts; or\

(A) The subcontractor is registered in SAM; and\
(B) The subcontractor represents that the size and socioeconomic status representations made in SAM are current, accurate and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontract.\
(iii) The prime contractor may not require the use of SAM for the purposes of representing size or socioeconomic status in connection with a subcontract.\
(iv) In accordance with 13 CFR 121.411, 126.900, 127.700, and 128.600, a prime contractor acting in good faith is not liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors regarding the subcontractor's size or socioeconomic status.\
(b) The contractor, the contracting officer, or any other interested party can challenge a subcontractor's size status representation by filing a protest, in accordance with 13 CFR 121.1001 through 121.1008.\

tribe.\
(B) If the ANC or Indian tribe designates more than one contractor to count the subcontract toward its goals, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate only a portion of the total subcontract award to each contractor. The sum of the amounts designated to various contractors cannot exceed the total value of the subcontract.\

(D) If the contracting officer does not receive a copy of the ANC's or the Indian tribe\'92s written designation within 30 days of the subcontract award, the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe will be considered the designated contractor.\
(2) A contractor acting in good faith may rely on the written representation of an ANC or an Indian tribe as to the status of the ANC or Indian tribe unless an interested party challenges its status or the contracting officer has independent reason to question its status. In the event of a challenge of a representation of an ANC or Indian tribe, the interested parties shall follow the procedures at \cf3 26.103\cf4 (b) through (e).\

(14) Assurances that the contractor will not prohibit a subcontractor from discussing with the contracting officer any material matter pertaining to payment to or utilization of a subcontractor; and\
(15) Assurances that the offeror will pay its small business subcontractors on time and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subcontract, and notify the contracting officer if the offeror pays a reduced or an untimely payment to a small business subcontractor (see \cf3 52.242-5\cf4 ).\
(b) Contractors may establish, on a plant or division-wide basis, a master plan (see \cf3 19.701\cf4 ) that contains all the elements required by the clause at \cf3 52.219-9\cf4 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, except goals. Master plans shall be effective for a 3- year period after approval by the contracting officer; however, it is incumbent upon contractors to maintain and update master plans. Changes required to update master plans are not effective until approved by the contracting officer. A master plan, when incorporated in an individual plan, shall apply to that contract throughout the life of the contract.\
(c) For multiyear contracts or contracts containing options, the cumulative value of the basic contract and all options is considered in determining whether a subcontracting plan is necessary. If a subcontracting plan is necessary and the offeror is submitting an individual subcontracting plan, the individual subcontracting plan shall contain all the elements required by paragraph (a) of this section and shall contain separate statements and goals based on total subcontract dollars for the basic contract and for each option.\
(d) A commercial plan (as defined in \cf3 19.701\cf4 ) is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial products and commercial services.

Once a contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service. The contractor shall\'97\
(1) Submit the commercial plan to either the first contracting officer awarding a contract subject to the plan during\
the contractor\'92s fiscal year, or, if the contractor has ongoing contracts with commercial plans, to the contracting officer responsible for the contract with the latest completion date. The contracting officer shall negotiate the commercial plan for the Government. The approved commercial plan shall remain in effect during the contractor\'92s fiscal year for all Government contracts in effect during that period;\
(2) Submit a new commercial plan, 30 working days before the end of the Contractor\'92s fiscal year, to the contracting officer responsible for the uncompleted Government contract with the latest completion date. The contractor must provide to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract subject to the plan, the identity of the contracting officer that will be negotiating the new plan;\
(3) When the new commercial plan is approved, provide a copy of the approved plan to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract that is subject to the plan; and\
(4) Comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (a)(10) of this section by submitting one SSR that includes all indirect costs, except as described in paragraph (d) of this section, in eSRS, for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report will be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the contracting officer who approved the plan. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government\'92s fiscal year.\

\f0\b 19.705 Responsibilities of the contracting officer under the subcontracting assistance program.\
19.705-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer may encourage the development of increased subcontracting opportunities in negotiated acquisition by providing monetary incentives such as payments based on actual subcontracting achievement or award-fee\

\fs20 contracting (see the clause at \cf3 52.219-10\cf4 , Incentive Subcontracting Program, and \cf3 19.708\cf4 (c)). When using any contractual incentive provision based upon rewarding the contractor monetarily for exceeding goals in the subcontracting plan, the contracting officer must ensure that (a) the goals are realistic and (b) any rewards for exceeding the goals are commensurate with the efforts the contractor would not have otherwise expended. Incentive provisions should normally be negotiated after reaching final agreement with the contractor on the subcontracting plan.\
(b) (1) Except where a contractor has a commercial plan, the contracting officer shall require a subcontracting plan\
for each indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract (including task or delivery order contracts, FSS, GWACs, and MACs), when the estimated value of the contract meets the subcontracting plan thresholds at \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a) and small business subcontracting opportunities exist.\
(2) Contracting officers placing orders may establish small business subcontracting goals for each order. Establishing goals shall not be in the form of a new subcontracting plan as a contract may not have more than one plan (\cf3 19.705-2\cf4 (e)).\

\f0\b 19.705-2 Determining the need for a subcontracting plan.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall take the following actions to determine whether a proposed contractual action requires a subcontracting plan:\
(a) (1) Determine whether the proposed total contract dollars will exceed the subcontracting plan threshold in \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a). (2) Determine whether a proposed modification will cause the total contract dollars to exceed the subcontracting plan\
threshold (see \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a)).\
(b) Determine whether subcontracting possibilities exist by considering relevant factors such as-\
(1) Whether firms engaged in the business of furnishing the types of items to be acquired customarily contract for performance of part of the work or maintain sufficient in-house capability to perform the work; and\
(2) Whether there are likely to be product prequalification requirements.\
(3) Whether the firm can acquire any portion of the work with minimal or no disruption to performance (with consideration given to the time remaining until contract completion), and at fair market value, when a determination is made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2).\
(c) If it is determined that there are no subcontracting possibilities, the determination shall include a detailed rationale, be approved at a level above the contracting officer, and placed in the contract file.\
(d) In solicitations for negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer may require the submission of subcontracting plans with initial offers, or at any other time prior to award. In determining when subcontracting plans should be required, as well as when and with whom plans should be negotiated, the contracting officer must consider the integrity of the competitive process, the goal of affording maximum practicable opportunity for small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns to participate, and the burden placed on offerors.\
(e) A contract may not have more than one subcontracting plan. However, a contracting officer may establish separate subcontracting goals for each order under an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract (\cf3 19.705-1\cf4 (b)(2)). When a contract modification exceeds the subcontracting plan threshold (see \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a)) or an option is exercised, the goals of an existing subcontracting plan shall be amended to reflect any new subcontracting opportunities not envisioned at the time of contract award. These goal changes do not apply retroactively.\
(f) If a subcontracting plan has been added to the contract due to a modification (see \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a)(1)(iii)) or a size re- representation (see \cf3 19.301-2\cf4 (e)), the subcontracting goals apply from the date of incorporation of the subcontracting plan into the contract and the contractor's achievements must be reported on the ISR (or the SF-294, if applicable) on a cumulative basis from the date of incorporation of the subcontracting plan into the contract.\

\f0\b 19.705-3 Preparing the solicitation.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall provide the Small Business Administration's (SBA\'92s) procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) a reasonable period of time to review any solicitation requiring submission of a subcontracting plan and to submit advisory findings before the solicitation is issued.\

\f0\b 19.705-4 Reviewing the subcontracting plan.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall review the subcontracting plan for adequacy, ensuring that the required information, goals, and assurances are included (see \cf3 19.704\cf4 ).\
(a) No detailed standards apply to every subcontracting plan. Instead, the contracting officer shall consider each plan in terms of the circumstances of the particular acquisition, including-\

\f1\b0 (1) Previous involvement of small business concerns as prime contractors or subcontractors in similar acquisitions; (2) Proven methods of involving small business concerns as subcontractors in similar acquisitions; and\
(3) The relative success of methods the contractor intends to use to meet the goals and requirements of the plan, as\
evidenced by records maintained by contractors.\
(b) If, under a sealed bid solicitation, a bidder submits a plan that does not cover each of the 15 required elements (see\
\cf3 19.704\cf4 ), the contracting officer shall advise the bidder of the deficiency and request submission of a revised plan by a specific date. If the bidder does not submit a plan that incorporates the required elements within the time allotted, the\
bidder shall be ineligible for award. If the plan, although responsive, evidences the bidder\'92s intention not to comply with its obligations under the clause at \cf3 52.219-8\cf4 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns, the contracting officer may find the bidder nonresponsible.\
(c) In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer shall determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the negotiation of each of the 15 elements of the plan (see \cf3 19.704\cf4 ). Subcontracting goals should be set at a level that the parties reasonably expect can result from the offeror expending good faith efforts to use small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The contracting officer shall take particular care to ensure that the offeror has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of substantiating good faith efforts. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the identification of steps that, if taken, would be considered a good faith effort (see \cf3 19.705-7\cf4 ). No goal should be negotiated upward if it is apparent that a higher goal will significantly increase the Government\'92s cost or seriously impede the attainment of acquisition objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see \cf3 52.219-10\cf4 , Incentive Subcontracting Program), may\
be used when additional and unique contract effort, such as providing technical assistance, could significantly increase subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran- owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business concerns.\
(d) In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan, the contracting officer should take the following actions:\
(1) Obtain information available from the cognizant contract administration office, as provided for in \cf3 19.706\cf4 (a), and evaluate the offeror\'92s past performance in awarding subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. If information is not available on a specific type of product or service, evaluate the offeror\'92s overall past performance and consider the performance of other contractors on similar efforts.\
(2) In accordance with \cf3 15 U.S.C.637(d)(4)(F)(iii)\cf4 , ensure that the goals offered are attainable in relation to-\
(i) The subcontracting opportunities available to the contractor, commensurate with the efficient and economical\
performance of the contract;\
(ii) The pool of eligible subcontractors available to fulfill the subcontracting opportunities; and\
(iii) The actual performance of such contractor in fulfilling the subcontracting goals specified in prior plans.\
(3) Ensure that the subcontracting goals are consistent with the offeror\'92s certified cost or pricing data or data other than certified cost or pricing data.\
(4) Evaluate the offeror\'92s make-or-buy policy or program to ensure that it does not conflict with the offeror\'92s proposed subcontracting plan and is in the Government\'92s interest. If the contract involves products or services that are particularly specialized or not generally available in the commercial market, consider the offeror\'92s current capacity to perform the work and the possibility of reduced subcontracting opportunities.\
(5) Evaluate subcontracting potential, considering the offeror\'92s make-or-buy policies or programs, the nature of the supplies or services to be subcontracted, the known availability of small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in the geographical area where the work will be performed, and the potential contractor\'92s long-standing contractual relationship with its suppliers.\
(6) Advise the offeror of available sources of information on potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors, as well as any specific concerns known to be potential subcontractors. If the offeror\'92s proposed goals are questionable, the contracting officer must emphasize that the information should be used to develop realistic and acceptable goals.\

determining contractor responsibility.\
(2) Assure that a subcontracting plan was submitted when required.\
(3) Notify the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see\

The notice shall be issued in sufficient time to provide the representative a reasonable time to review the material and submit advisory recommendations to the contracting officer. Failure of the representative to respond in a reasonable period of time shall not delay contract award.\
(4) Determine any fee that may be payable if an incentive is used in conjunction with the subcontracting plan.\
(5) Ensure that an acceptable plan is incorporated into and made a material part of the contract.\
(b) Letter contracts and similar undefinitized instruments, which would otherwise meet the requirements of \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a)(1)\
(i) and (ii), shall contain at least a preliminary basic plan addressing the requirements of \cf3 19.704 \cf4 and in such cases require the negotiation of the final plan within 90 days after award or before definitization, whichever occurs first.\

\f0\b 19.705-6 Postaward responsibilities of the contracting officer.\

\f1\b0 After a contract or contract modification containing a subcontracting plan is awarded or an existing subcontracting plan is amended, the contracting officer shall do the following:\
(a) Notify the SBA of the award by sending a copy of the award document to the Area Director, Office of Government Contracting, in the SBA area office where the contract will be performed.\
(b) Forward a copy of each commercial plan and any associated approvals to the Area Director, Office of Government Contracting, in the SBA area office where the contractor\'92s headquarters is located.\
(c) Give to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) a copy of-\
(1) Any subcontracting plan submitted in response to a sealed bid solicitation; and\
(2) The final negotiated subcontracting plan that was incorporated into a negotiated contract or contract modification. (d) Notify the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see\

contract administration office.\
(f) Monitor the prime contractor's compliance with its subcontracting plan, to include the following:\
(1) Ensure that subcontracting reports are submitted into the eSRS within 30 days after the report ending date (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , by October 30 th for the fiscal year ended September 30 th).\
(2) Review ISRs, and where applicable, SSRs, in eSRS within 60 days of the report ending date (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , by November 30 th for a report submitted for the fiscal year ended September 30 th).\
(3) Either acknowledge receipt of or reject the reports in accordance with \cf3 subpart 19.7\cf4 , \cf3 52.219-9\cf4 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, and the eSRS instructions (\cf3 www.esrs.gov\cf4 ).\

(g) Evaluate the prime contractor's compliance with its subcontracting plan, to include the following:\
(1) Assess whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan.\
See \cf3 19.705-7\cf4 (b) for more information on the determination of good faith effort.\
(2) Assess the prime contractor's written explanation concerning the prime contractor's failure to use a small business\

(j) Acknowledge receipt of or reject the ISR and the SSR in the eSRS. Acknowledging receipt does not mean acceptance or approval of the report. The report shall be rejected if it is not adequately completed, for instance, if there are errors, omissions, or incomplete data. Failure to meet the goals of the subcontracting plan is not a valid reason for rejecting the report.\

\f0\b 19.705-7 Compliance with the subcontracting plan.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General. 
\f1\i0 Maximum practicable utilization of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran- owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and \cf3 15 U.S.C.637(d)(4)(F) \cf4 directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.\
(b) 
\f2\i Determination of good faith effort. 
\f1\i0 (1) In determining whether a contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, a contracting officer must look to the totality of the contractor's actions, consistent with the information and assurances provided in its plan. The fact that the contractor failed to meet its subcontracting goals does not, in and of itself, constitute a failure to make a good faith effort (see \cf3 19.701\cf4 ). For example, notwithstanding a contractor's diligent effort to identify and solicit offers from any of the small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, factors such as unavailability of anticipated sources or unreasonable prices may frustrate achievement of the contractor's subcontracting goals. The contracting officer may consider any of the following, though not all inclusive, to be indicators of a good faith effort:\
(i) Breaking out work to be subcontracted into economically feasible units, as appropriate, to facilitate small business participation.\
(ii) Conducting market research to identify potential small business subcontractors through all reasonable means, such as searching SAM, posting notices or solicitations on SBA's SUBNet, participating in business matchmaking events, and attending preproposal conferences.\
(iii) Soliciting small business concerns as early in the acquisition process as practicable to allow them sufficient time to submit a timely offer for the subcontract.\
(iv) Providing interested small businesses with adequate and timely information about plans, specifications, and requirements for performance of the prime contract to assist them in submitting a timely offer for the subcontract.\
(v) Negotiating in good faith with interested small businesses.\
(vi) Directing small businesses that need additional assistance to SBA.\
(vii) Assisting interested small businesses in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, required insurance, necessary\
equipment, supplies, materials, or services.\
(viii) Utilizing the available services of small business associations; local, state, and Federal small business\
assistance offices; and other organizations.\
(ix) Participating in a formal mentor-prot\'e9g\'e9 program with one or more small business prot\'e9g\'e9s that results in\
developmental assistance to the prot\'e9g\'e9s.\
(x) Although failing to meet the subcontracting goal in one socioeconomic category, exceeding the goal by an equal\
or greater amount in one or more of the other categories.\
(xi) Fulfilling all of the requirements of the subcontracting plan.\
(2) When considered in the context of the contractor's total effort in accordance with its plan, the contracting officer may consider any of the following, though not all inclusive, to be indicators of a failure to make a good faith effort:\
(i) Failure to attempt through market research to identify, contact, solicit, or consider for contract award small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concerns, through all reasonable means including outreach, industry days, or the use of Federal systems such as SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search or SUBNet systems.\
(ii) Failure to designate and maintain a company official to administer the subcontracting program and monitor and enforce compliance with the plan.\

\fs20 (iii) Failure to submit an acceptable ISR, or the SSR, using the eSRS, or as provided in agency regulations, by the report due dates specified in \cf3 52.219-9\cf4 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan.\
(iv) Failure to maintain records or otherwise demonstrate procedures adopted to comply with the plan including subcontracting flowdown requirements.\
(v) Adoption of company policies or documented procedures that have as their objectives the frustration of the objectives of the plan.\
(vi) Failure to pay small business subcontractors in accordance with the terms of the contract with the prime contractor.\
(vii) Failure to correct substantiated findings from Federal subcontracting compliance reviews or participate in subcontracting plan management training offered by the Government.\
(viii) Failure to provide the contracting officer with a written explanation if the contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials or obtain the performance of construction work as described in \cf3 19.704\cf4 (a)(12).\
(ix) Falsifying records of subcontract awards to small business concerns.\
(c) 
\f2\i Documentation of good faith effort. 
\f1\i0 If, at completion of the basic contract or any option, or in the case of a commercial\
plan, at the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable, a contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its subcontracting plan, which includes meeting its subcontracting goals, the contracting officer shall review all available information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort to comply with the plan. If no such indication is found, the contracting officer shall document the file accordingly.\
(d) 
\f2\i Notice of failure to make a good faith effort. 
\f1\i0 If the contracting officer decides in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice in accordance with \cf3 52.219-16\cf4 , Liquidated Damages\'97Subcontracting Plan, specifying the material breach, which may be included in the contractor's past performance information, advising the contractor of\
the possibility that the contractor may have to pay to the Government liquidated damages, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period as necessary) within which to respond. The notice shall give the contractor an opportunity to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made before the contracting officer issues the final decision and shall further state that failure of the contractor to respond may be taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.\
(e) 
\f2\i Payment of liquidated damages. 
\f1\i0 (1) If, after consideration of all the pertinent data, the contracting officer finds that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision to the contractor to that effect and require the payment of liquidated damages in an amount stated. The contracting officer's final decision shall state that the contractor has the right to appeal under the clause in the contract entitled Disputes. Calculations and procedures shall be in accordance with \cf3 52.219-16\cf4 , Liquidated Damages\'97Subcontracting Plan.\
(2) The amount of damages attributable to the contractor's failure to comply shall be an amount equal to the actual dollar amount by which the contractor failed to achieve each subcontracting goal. For calculations for commercial plans see paragraph (f) of this section.\
(3) Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies that the Government may have.\
(f) 
\f2\i Commercial plans. 
\f1\i0 With respect to commercial plans approved under the clause at \cf3 52.219-9\cf4 , Small Business\
Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer that approved the plan shall-\
(1) Perform the functions of the contracting officer under this subsection on behalf of all agencies with contracts\
covered by the commercial plan;\
(2) Determine whether or not the goals in the commercial plan were achieved and, if they were not achieved, review\
all available information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort to comply with the plan, and document the results of the review;\
(3) If a determination is made to assess liquidated damages, in order to calculate and assess the amount of damages, the contracting officer shall ask the contractor to provide-\
(i) Contract numbers for the Government contracts subject to the plan;\
(ii) The total Government sales during the contractor\'92s fiscal year; and\
(iii) The amount of payments made under the Government contracts subject to that plan that contributed to the\
contractor\'92s total sales during the contractor\'92s fiscal year; and\
(4) When appropriate, assess liquidated damages on the Government\'92s behalf, based on the pro rata share of\
subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts. For example: The contractor\'92s total actual sales were $50 million and its actual subcontracting was $20 million. The Government\'92s total payments under contracts subject to the plan contributing to the contractor\'92s total sales were $5 million, which accounted for 10 percent of the contractor\'92s total sales. Therefore, the pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts would be 10 percent of $20 million,\

\f1\b0 or $2 million. To continue the example, if the contractor failed to achieve its small business goal by 1 percent, the liquidated damages would be calculated as 1 percent of $2 million, or $20,000. The contracting officer shall make similar calculations for each category of small business where the contractor failed to achieve its goal and the sum of the dollars for all of the categories equals the amount of the liquidated damages to be assessed. A copy of the contracting officer\'92s final decision assessing liquidated damages shall be provided to other contracting officers with contracts subject to the commercial plan.\
(5) Every contracting officer with a contract that is subject to a commercial plan shall include in the contract file a copy of the approved plan and a copy of the final decision assessing liquidating damages, if applicable.\

\f0\b 19.706 Responsibilities of the cognizant administrative contracting officer.\

\f1\b0 The administrative contracting officer is responsible for assisting in evaluating subcontracting plans, and for monitoring, evaluating, and documenting contractor performance under the clause prescribed in \cf3 19.708\cf4 (b) and any subcontracting plan included in the contract. The contract administration office shall provide the necessary information and advice to support the contracting officer, as appropriate, by furnishing-\
(a) Documentation on the contractor\'92s performance and compliance with subcontracting plans under previous contracts;\
(b) Information on the extent to which the contractor is meeting the plan\'92s goals for subcontracting with eligible small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns;\
(c) Information on whether the contractor\'92s efforts to ensure the participation of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns are in accordance with its subcontracting plan;\
(d) Information on whether the contractor is requiring its subcontractors to adopt similar subcontracting plans;\
(e) Immediate notice if, during performance, the contractor is failing to meet its commitments under the clause prescribed in \cf3 19.708\cf4 (b) or the subcontracting plan;\
(f) Immediate notice and rationale if, during performance, the contractor is failing to comply in good faith with the subcontracting plan (see \cf3 19.705-7\cf4 (b) for more information on the determination of good faith effort); and\
(g) Immediate notice that performance under a contract is complete, that the goals were or were not met, and, if not met, whether there is any indication of a lack of a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting plan.\

\f0\b 19.707 The Small Business Administration\'92s role in carrying out the program.\

\f1\b0 (a) Under the program, the SBA may-\
(1) Assist both Government agencies and contractors in carrying out their responsibilities with regard to subcontracting\
plans;\
(2) Review (within 5 working days) any solicitation that meets the dollar threshold in \cf3 19.702\cf4 (a)(1)(i) or (ii) before the\
solicitation is issued;\
(3) Review (within 5 working days) before execution any negotiated contractual document requiring a subcontracting\
plan, including the plan itself, and submit recommendations to the contracting officer, which shall be advisory in nature; and (4) Evaluate compliance with subcontracting plans, either on a contract-by-contract basis, or, in the case of contractors\
having multiple contracts, on an aggregate basis. (b) The SBA is not authorized to-\
(1) Prescribe the extent to which any contractor or subcontractor shall subcontract,\
(2) Specify concerns to which subcontracts will be awarded, or\
(3) Exercise any authority regarding the administration of individual prime contracts or subcontracts.\

\f0\b 19.708 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.219-8\cf4 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns, in solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold unless-\
(1) A personal services contract is contemplated (see \cf3 37.104\cf4 ); or\
(2) The contract, together with all of its subcontracts, will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas.\
(b) (1) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.219-9\cf4 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations and contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities, are expected to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction of any public facility), and are required to include the clause at \cf3 52.219-8\cf4 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns, unless the acquisition is set aside or is to be accomplished under the 8(a) program.

substantially the same as the clause at \cf3 52.219-10\cf4 , Incentive Subcontracting Program, when a subcontracting plan is required (see \cf3 19.702\cf4 ), and inclusion of a monetary incentive is, in the judgment of the contracting officer, necessary to increase subcontracting opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, and is commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract; unless the conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are applicable. The contracting officer may vary the terms of the clause as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\
(2) Various approaches may be used in the development of small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns\'92 subcontracting incentives. They can take many forms, from a fully quantified schedule of payments based on actual subcontract achievement to an award-fee approach employing subjective evaluation criteria (see paragraph (c)\
(3) of this section). The incentive should not reward the contractor for results other than those that are attributable to the contractor\'92s efforts under the incentive subcontracting program.\

\fs24 Subpart 19.8 - Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program)\

\fs20 19.800 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (\cf3 15 U.S.C.637(a)\cf4 ) established a program that authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to enter into all types of contracts with other agencies and award subcontracts for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation. This program is the "8(a) Business Development Program," commonly referred to as the "8(a) program." A small business that is accepted into the 8(a) program is known as a "participant." SBA\'92s subcontractors are referred to as "8(a) contractors." As used in this subpart, an 8(a) contractor is an 8(a) participant that is currently performing on a Federal contract or order that was set aside for 8(a) participants.\
(b) Contracts may be awarded to the SBA for performance by eligible 8(a) participants on either a sole source or competitive basis.\
(c) Acting under the authority of the program, the SBA certifies to an agency that SBA is competent and responsible to perform a specific contract. The contracting officer has the discretion to award the contract to the SBA based upon mutually agreeable terms and conditions.\
(d) The contracting officer shall comply with \cf3 19.203 \cf4 before deciding to offer an acquisition to a small business concern under the 8(a) program. For acquisitions above the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer shall consider 8(a) set-asides or sole source awards before considering small business set-asides.\
(e) When SBA has delegated its 8(a) program contract execution authority to an agency, the contracting officer must refer to its agency supplement or other policy directives for appropriate guidance.\

\f0\b 19.801 [Reserved]\
19.802 Determining eligibility for the 8(a) program.\

\f1\b0 Determining the eligibility of a small business to be a participant in the 8(a) program is the responsibility of the SBA. SBA\'92s regulations on eligibility requirements for participation in the 8(a) program are found at 13 CFR 124.101 through 124.112. SBA designates the concern as an 8(a) participant in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) at 
\f2\i \cf3 https:// web.sba.gov/pro-net/search/dsp_dsbs.cfm 
\f1\i0 \cf4 . SBA's designation also appears in the System for Award Management (SAM).\

\f0\b 19.803 Selecting acquisitions for the 8(a) Program.\

\f1\b0 Through their cooperative efforts, the SBA and an agency match the agency's requirements with the capabilities of 8(a) participants to establish a basis for the agency to contract with the SBA under the program. Selection is initiated in one of three ways:\
(a) The SBA advises the contracting activity of an 8(a) participant's capabilities through a search letter and requests the contracting activity to identify acquisitions to support the participant's business plans. In these instances, the SBA will provide at a minimum the following information in order to enable the contracting activity to match an acquisition to the participant's capabilities:\
(1) Identification of the participant and its owners.\
(2) Background information on the participant, including any and all information pertaining to the participant's technical ability and capacity to perform.\
(3) The participant's present production capacity and related facilities.\
(4) The extent to which contracting assistance is needed in the present and the future, described in terms that will enable the agency to relate the participant's plans to present and future agency requirements.\
(5) If construction is involved, the request shall also include the following:\
(i) A participant's capabilities in and qualifications for accomplishing various categories of construction work\
typically found in North American Industrial Category System subsector 236 (construction of buildings), subsector 237 (heavy and civil engineering construction), or subsector 238 (specialty trade contractors).\
(ii) The participant\'92s capacity in each construction category in terms of estimated dollar value (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , electrical, up to $100,000).\
(b) The SBA identifies a specific requirement for one or more 8(a) participant(s) and sends a requirements letter to the agency's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, or for the Department of Defense, Office of Small Business Programs, requesting the contracting office offer the acquisition to the 8(a) program. In these instances, in addition to the information in paragraph (a) of this section, the SBA will provide-\
(1) A clear identification of the acquisition sought; 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , project name or number;\

\fs20 (2) A statement as to how the required equipment and real property will be provided in order to ensure that the participant will be fully capable of satisfying the agency's requirements;\
(3) If construction, information as to the bonding capability of the participant(s); and (4) Either-\
(i) If a sole source request-\
(A) The reasons why the participant is considered suitable for this particular acquisition; 
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , previous contracts\
for the same or similar supply or service; and\
(B) A statement that the participant is eligible in terms of its small business size status relative to the assigned\
NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets; or\
(ii) If competitive, a statement that at least two 8(a) participants are considered capable of satisfying the agency's\
requirements and a statement that the participants are also eligible in terms of their small business size status relative to the assigned NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets. If requested by the contracting office, SBA will identify at least two such participants and provide information concerning the participants\'92 capabilities.\
(c) Agencies may also review other proposed acquisitions for the purpose of identifying requirements which may be offered to the SBA. Where agencies independently, or through the self marketing efforts of an 8(a) participant, identify a requirement for the 8(a) program, they may offer on behalf of a specific 8(a) participant, for the 8(a) program in general, or for 8(a) competition.\

\f0\b 19.804 Evaluation, offering, and acceptance.\
19.804-1 Agency evaluation.\

\f1\b0 In determining the extent to which a requirement should be offered in support of the 8(a) program, the agency should evaluate-\
(a) Current and future plans to acquire the specific items or work that 8(a) participants are seeking to provide, identified in terms of-\
(1) Estimated quantities of the supplies or services required or the estimated number of construction projects planned; (2) Length of contract, including option periods (see \cf3 19.812\cf4 (d)); and\
(3) Performance or delivery requirements, including\'96\
(i) Required monthly production rates, when applicable; and\
(ii) For construction, the geographical location where work is to be performed;\
(b) The impact of any delay in delivery;\
(c) Whether the items or work have previously been acquired using small business set-asides, and the date the items or\
work were acquired;\
(d) Problems encountered in previous acquisitions of the items or work from the 8(a) participants or other contractors; and (e) Any other pertinent information about known 8(a) participants, the items, or the work. This includes any information\
concerning the participants' products or capabilities. When necessary, the contracting agency shall make an independent review of the factors in \cf3 19.803\cf4 (a) and other aspects of the participants' capabilities which would ensure the satisfactory performance of the requirement being considered for commitment to the 8(a) program.\

\f0\b 19.804-2 Agency offering.\

\f1\b0 (a) After completing its evaluation, the contracting office shall notify the SBA of the extent of its plans to place 8(a) contracts with the SBA for specific quantities of items or work, including 8(a) contracts that are reserved in accordance with 19.503. The notification, referred to as an offering letter, shall identify the time frames within which resulting 8(a) awards must be completed in order for the agency to meet its responsibilities. The offering letter shall also contain the following information applicable to each prospective contract:\
(1) A description of the work to be performed or items to be delivered, and a copy of the statement of work, if available.\
(2) The estimated period of performance.\
(3) The NAICS code that applies to the principal nature of the acquisition.\
(4) The anticipated dollar value of the requirement, including options, if any.\
(5) Any special restrictions or geographical limitations on the requirement (for construction, include the location of the\
work to be performed).\
(6) Any special capabilities or disciplines needed for contract performance.\

(9) A statement that prior to the offering no solicitation for the specific acquisition has been issued as a small business, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside, or a set-aside under the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program, and that no other public communication (such as a notice through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE)) has been made showing the contracting agency\'92s clear intention to set-aside the acquisition for small business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, or a set-aside under the WOSB Program.\
(10) Identification of any particular 8(a) participant designated for consideration, including a brief justification, such as- (i) The 8(a) participant, through its own efforts, marketed the requirement and caused it to be reserved for the 8(a)\
program; or\
(ii) The acquisition is a follow-on or renewal contract and the nominated 8(a) participant is the incumbent.\
(11) Bonding requirements, if applicable.\
(12) Identification of all 8(a) participants which have expressed an interest in being considered for the acquisition. (13) Identification of all SBA field offices that have asked for the acquisition for the 8(a) program.\
(14) A request, if appropriate, that a requirement with an estimated contract value under the applicable competitive\
threshold be awarded as an 8(a) competitive contract (see \cf3 19.805-1\cf4 (d)).\
(15) A request, if appropriate, that a requirement with a contract value over the applicable competitive threshold be\
awarded as a sole source contract (see \cf3 19.805-1\cf4 (b)).\
(16) Any other pertinent and reasonably available data.\
(b) (1) An agency offering a construction requirement for which no specific offeror is nominated should submit it to the SBA District Office for the geographical area where the work is to be performed.\
(2) An agency offering a construction requirement on behalf of a specific offeror should submit it to the SBA District Office servicing that concern.\
(3) Sole source requirements, other than construction, should be forwarded directly to the district office that services the nominated 8(a) participant. If the contracting officer is not nominating a specific 8(a) participant, the offering letter should be forwarded to the district office servicing the geographical area in which the contracting office is located.\
(c) All requirements for 8(a) competition, other than construction, should be forwarded to the district office servicing the geographical area in which the contracting office is located. All requirements for 8(a) construction competition should be forwarded to the district office servicing the geographical area in which all or the major portion of the construction is to be performed. All requirements, including construction, must be synopsized through the GPE. For construction, the synopsis must include the geographical area of the competition set forth in the SBA\'92s acceptance letter.\

\f0\b 19.804-3 SBA acceptance.\

\f1\b0 (a) Upon receipt of the contracting office's offering letter, SBA will determine whether to accept the requirement for the 8(a) program. SBA\'92s decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the contracting office in writing within 10 working days of receipt of the offer if the contract is likely to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and within two working days of receipt if the contract is at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting office may grant an extension of these time periods, if requested by SBA.\
(1) For acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, if SBA does not respond to an offering letter within ten working days, the contracting office may seek SBA\'92s acceptance through the Associate Administrator for Business Development. The contracting office may assume that SBA has accepted the requirement into the 8(a) program if it does\
not receive a reply from the Associate Administrator for Business Development within five calendar days of receipt of the contracting office's request.\
(2) For acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, when the contracting office makes an offer to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific 8(a) participant and does not receive a reply to its offering letter within two working days, the contracting office may assume the offer is accepted and proceed with award of an 8(a) contract.\
(b) As part of the acceptance process, SBA will review the appropriateness of the NAICS code designation assigned to the requirement by the contracting officer.\
(1) SBA will not challenge the NAICS code assigned to the requirement by the contracting officer if it is reasonable, even though other NAICS codes may also be reasonable.\
(2) If SBA and the contracting officer are unable to agree on a NAICS code designation for the requirement, SBA may refuse to accept the requirement for the 8(a) program, appeal the contracting officer's determination to the head of the agency\

(c) 
\f2\i Sole source 8(a) awards
\f1\i0 . If an appropriate match exists, SBA will advise the contracting officer whether it will participate in contract negotiations or whether SBA will authorize the contracting officer to negotiate directly with the identified 8(a) participant. Where SBA has delegated its contract execution functions to a contracting agency, SBA will also identify that delegation in its acceptance letter. For a joint venture, SBA will determine eligibility as part of its acceptance of a sole-source requirement and will approve the joint venture agreement prior to award in accordance with \cf3 13 CFR 124.513(e)\cf4 .\
(1) Sole source award where the contracting officer nominates a specific 8(a) participant. SBA will determine whether an appropriate match exists where the contracting officer identifies a particular participant for a sole source award.\
(i) Once SBA determines that a procurement is suitable to be accepted as an 8(a) sole source contract, SBA will normally accept it on behalf of the 8(a) participant recommended by the contracting officer, provided that the 8(a) participant complies with the requirements of 13 CFR 124.503(c)(1).\
(ii) If an appropriate match does not exist, SBA will notify the 8(a) participant and the contracting officer, and may then nominate an alternate 8(a) participant.\
(2) Sole source award where the contracting officer does not nominate a specific 8(a) participant. When a contracting officer does not nominate an 8(a) participant for performance of a sole source 8(a) contract, SBA will select an 8(a) participant for possible award from among two or more eligible and qualified 8(a) participants. The selection will be based upon relevant factors, including business development needs, compliance with competitive business mix requirements (if applicable), financial condition, management ability, technical capability, and whether award will promote the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts. (For construction requirements see 13 CFR 124.503(d)(1)).\

\f0\b 19.804-4 Repetitive acquisitions.\

\f1\b0 In order for repetitive acquisitions to be awarded through the 8(a) program, there must be separate offers and acceptances. This allows the SBA to determine-\
(a) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;\
(b) A nominated 8(a) participant's eligibility, and whether or not it is the same 8(a) participant that performed the previous contract;\
(c) The effect that contract award would have on the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts; and (d) Whether the requirement should continue under the 8(a) program.\

\f0\b 19.804-5 Basic ordering agreements and blanket purchase agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting office shall submit an offering letter for, and SBA must accept, each order under a basic ordering agreement (BOA) or a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) issued under part 13 (see 13.303), in addition to the agency offering and SBA accepting the BOA or BPA itself.\
(b) SBA will not accept for award on a sole-source basis any order that would cause the total dollar amount of orders issued under a specific BOA or BPA to exceed the competitive threshold amount in \cf3 19.805-1\cf4 .\
(c) Once an 8(a) participant's program term expires, the participant otherwise exits the 8(a) program, or becomes other than small for the NAICS code assigned under the BOA or the BPA, SBA will not accept new orders under the BOA or BPA for the participant.\

\f0\b 19.804-6 Indefinite delivery contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) Separate offers and acceptances are not required for individual orders under multiple-award contracts (including the Federal Supply Schedules managed by GSA, multi-agency contracts or Governmentwide acquisition contracts, or indefinite- delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts) that have been set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) contractors, and the individual order is to be competed among all 8(a) contract holders. SBA's acceptance of the original contract is valid for the term of the contract. Offers and acceptances are required for individual orders under multiple-award contracts that have not been set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) contractors.\
(b) The contracting officer may issue an order on a sole source basis when\'97\
(1) The multiple-award contract was set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) participants;\
(2) The order has an estimated value less than or equal to the dollar thresholds set forth at \cf3 19.805-1\cf4 (a)(2); and (3) The offering and acceptance procedures at \cf3 19.804-2 \cf4 and \cf3 19.804-3 \cf4 are followed.\
(c) The contracting officer may issue an order directly to one 8(a) contractor in accordance with \cf3 19.504\cf4 (c)(1)(ii) when\'97 19.8-4\

(2) The order has an estimated value less than or equal to $7 million for acquisitions assigned manufacturing NAICS codes and $4.5 million for all other acquisitions; and\
(3) The offering and acceptance procedures at \cf3 19.804-2 \cf4 and \cf3 19.804-3 \cf4 are followed.\
(d) An 8(a) contractor may continue to accept new orders under the contract, even if it exits the 8(a) program, or becomes\
other than small for the NAICS code(s) assigned to the contract.\
(e) Agencies may continue to take credit toward their prime contracting small disadvantaged business or small business\
goals for orders awarded to 8(a) contractors, even after the contractor's 8(a) program term expires, the contractor otherwise exits the 8(a) program, or the contractor becomes other than small for the NAICS code(s) assigned under the 8(a) contract. However, if an 8(a) contractor rerepresents that it is other than small for the NAICS code(s) assigned under the contract in accordance with \cf3 19.301-2 \cf4 or, where ownership or control of the 8(a) contractor has changed and SBA has granted a waiver to allow the contractor to continue performance (see 13 CFR 124.515), the agency may not credit any subsequent orders awarded to the contractor towards its small disadvantaged business or small business goals.\

\f0\b 19.805 Competitive 8(a).\
19.805-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an acquisition offered to the SBA under the 8(a) program shall be awarded on the basis of competition limited to eligible 8(a) participants when-\
(1) There is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price; and\
(2) The anticipated total value of the contract, including options, will exceed $7 million for acquisitions assigned manufacturing North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and $4.5 million for all other acquisitions.\
(b) Where an acquisition exceeds the competitive threshold (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section), the SBA may accept the requirement for a sole source 8(a) award if-\
(1) There is not a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) participants will submit offers at a fair market price; or\
(2) SBA accepts the requirement on behalf of a concern owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation.\
(c) A proposed 8(a) requirement with an estimated value exceeding the applicable competitive threshold amount shall not be divided into several requirements for lesser amounts in order to use 8(a) sole source procedures for award to a single firm.\
(d) The SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development may approve a contracting office's request for a competitive 8(a) award below the competitive thresholds. Such requests will be approved only on a limited basis and will\
be primarily granted where technical competitions are appropriate or where a large number of responsible 8(a) participants are available for competition. In determining whether a request to compete below the threshold will be approved, the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development will, in part, consider the extent to which the contracting activity is supporting the 8(a) program on a noncompetitive basis. The agency may include recommendations for competition below the threshold in the offering letter or by separate correspondence to the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development.\

\f0\b 19.805-2 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Offers shall be solicited from those sources identified in accordance with \cf3 19.804-3\cf4 .\
(b) The SBA will determine the eligibility of the apparent successful offeror. Eligibility is based on section 8(a) program criteria (see \cf3 13 CFR 124.501(g) \cf4 and \cf3 19.816\cf4 (c)).\
(1) In either negotiated or sealed bid competitive 8(a) acquisitions SBA will determine the eligibility of the apparent successful offeror and advise the contracting office within 5 working days after receipt of the contracting office's request for an eligibility determination.\
(i) If SBA determines that the apparent successful offeror is ineligible, the contracting office will then send to SBA the identity of the next highest evaluated offeror for an eligibility determination. The process is repeated until SBA determines that an identified offeror is eligible for award.\
(ii) If the contracting officer believes that the apparent successful offeror (or the offeror SBA has determined eligible for award) is not responsible to perform the contract, the contracting officer must refer the matter to SBA for Certificate of Competency consideration under subpart \cf3 19.6\cf4 .\
(2) For a two-step design-build procurement, an 8(a) participant must be eligible for award under the 8(a) program on the initial date for receipt of phase one offers specified in the solicitation (see \cf3 13 CFR 124.507(d)(3)\cf4 .\

\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (3) In any case in which an 8(a) participant is determined to be ineligible, SBA will notify the 8(a) participant of that determination.\
(c) Any party with information questioning the eligibility of an 8(a) participant to continue participation in the 8(a) program or for the purposes of a specific 8(a) award may submit such information to the SBA in accordance with 13 CFR 124.112(c).\
(d) (1) SBA does not certify joint ventures, as entities, into the 8(a) program.\
(2) A contracting officer may consider a joint venture for contract award. SBA does not approve joint ventures for\
competitive awards (but see \cf3 13 CFR 124.501(g) \cf4 for SBA's determination of participant eligibility).\

\f0\b 19.806 Pricing the 8(a) contract.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall price the 8(a) contract in accordance with \cf3 subpart 15.4\cf4 . If required by \cf3 subpart 15.4\cf4 , the SBA shall obtain certified cost or pricing data from the 8(a) contractor. If the SBA requests audit assistance to determine the proposed price to be fair and reasonable in a sole source acquisition, the contracting activity shall furnish it to the extent it is available.\
(b) An 8(a) contract, sole source or competitive, may not be awarded if the price of the contract results in a cost to the contracting agency which exceeds a fair market price.\
(c) If requested by the SBA, the contracting officer shall make available the data used to estimate the fair market price within 10 working days.\
(d) The negotiated contract price and the estimated fair market price are subject to the concurrence of the SBA. In the event of a disagreement between the contracting officer and the SBA, the SBA may appeal in accordance with \cf3 19.810\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.807 Estimating fair market price.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall estimate the fair market price of the work to be performed by the 8(a) contractor.\
(b) In estimating the fair market price for an acquisition other than those covered in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer shall use cost or price analysis and consider commercial prices for similar products and services, available in-house cost estimates, data (including certified cost or pricing data) submitted by the SBA or the 8(a) contractor, and data obtained from any other Government agency.\
(c) In estimating a fair market price for a repeat purchase, the contracting officer shall consider recent award prices for the same items or work if there is comparability in quantities, conditions, terms, and performance times. The estimated price should be adjusted to reflect differences in specifications, plans, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, and other circumstances. Price indices may be used as guides to determine the changes in labor and material costs. Comparison of commercial prices for similar items may also be used.\

\f0\b 19.808 Contract negotiation.\
19.808-1 Sole source.\

\f1\b0 (a) The SBA may not accept for negotiation a sole-source 8(a) contract that exceeds $25 million unless the requesting agency has completed a justification in accordance with the requirements of \cf3 6.303\cf4 .\
(b) The SBA is responsible for initiating negotiations with the agency within the time established by the agency. If the SBA does not initiate negotiations within the agreed time and the agency cannot allow additional time, the agency may, after notifying the SBA, proceed with the acquisition from other sources.\
(c) The SBA should participate, whenever practicable, in negotiating the contracting terms. When mutually agreeable, the SBA may authorize the contracting officer to negotiate directly with the 8(a) participant. Whether or not direct negotiations take place, the SBA is responsible for approving the resulting contract before award.\
(d) An 8(a) participant must represent that it is a small business in accordance with the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.\
(e) A concern must be a current participant in the 8(a) program at the time of an 8(a) sole-source award.\
(f) An 8(a) participant owned by an Alaska Native Corporation, Indian Tribe, Native Hawaiian Organization, or Community Development Corporation may not receive an 8(a) sole-source award that is a follow-on contract to an 8(a) contract, if the predecessor contract was performed by another 8(a) participant (or former 8(a) participant) owned by the same Alaska Native Corporation, Indian Tribe, Native Hawaiian Organization, or Community Development Corporation (See 13 CFR 124.109 through 124.111).\

 19.808-2 Competitive.\

\f1\b0 In competitive 8(a) acquisitions, including follow-on 8(a) acquisitions, subject to part 15, the contracting officer conducts negotiations directly with the competing 8(a) participants. Conducting competitive negotiations among eligible 8(a) participants prior to SBA's formal acceptance of the acquisition for the 8(a) program may be grounds for the SBA's not accepting the acquisition for the 8(a) program.\

\f0\b 19.809 Preaward considerations.\
19.809-1 Preaward survey.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer should request a preaward survey of the 8(a) participant whenever considered useful. If the results of the preaward survey or other information available to the contracting officer raise substantial doubt as to the participant's ability to perform, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to SBA for Certificate of Competency consideration under \cf3 subpart 19.6\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.809-2 Limitations on subcontracting and nonmanufacturer rule.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Limitations on subcontracting. 
\f1\i0 To be awarded a contract or order under the 8(a) program, the 8(a) participant is required to perform\'97\
(1) For services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost incurred for personnel with its own employees;\
(2) For supplies or products (other than a procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies or products), at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies or products (not including the cost of materials);\
(3) For general construction, at least 15 percent of the cost with its own employees (not including the cost of materials); and\
(4) For construction by special trade contractors, at least 25 percent of the cost with its own employees (not including the cost of materials).\
(b) 
\f2\i Compliance period. 
\f1\i0 An 8(a) contractor is required to comply with the limitations on subcontracting\'97\
(1) For a contract under the 8(a) program, either by the end of the base term and then by the end of each subsequent option period or by the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract, at the contracting officer's\
discretion; and\
(2) For an order competed exclusively among contractors who are 8(a) participants or for an order issued directly to one\
8(a) contractor in accordance with \cf3 19.504\cf4 (c)(1)(ii), by the end of the performance period for the order.\
(c) 
\f2\i Waiver. 
\f1\i0 The applicable SBA District Director may waive the provisions in paragraph (b)(1) requiring a participant\
to comply with the limitations on subcontracting for each period of performance or for each order. Instead, the SBA District Director may permit the participant to subcontract in excess of the limitations on subcontracting where the SBA District Director makes a written determination that larger amounts of subcontracting are essential during certain stages of performance.\
(1) The 8(a) participant is required to provide the SBA District Director written assurance that the participant will ultimately comply with the requirements of this section prior to contract completion. The contracting officer shall review the written assurance and inform the 8(a) participant of their concurrence or nonconcurrence. The 8(a) participant can only submit the written assurance to the SBA District Director upon concurrence by the contracting officer.\
(2) The contracting officer does not have the authority to waive the provisions of this section requiring an 8(a) participant to comply with the limitations on subcontracting for each period of performance or order, even if the agency has a Partnership Agreement with SBA.\
(3) Where the 8(a) participant does not ultimately comply with the limitations on subcontracting by the end of the contract, SBA will not grant future waivers for the 8(a) participant.\
(d) 
\f2\i Nonmanufacturer rule. 
\f1\i0 See \cf3 19.505\cf4 (c) for application of the nonmanufacturer rule, inclusive of waivers and exceptions to the nonmanufacturer rule.\

\f0\b 19.810 SBA appeals.\

\f1\b0 (a) The SBA Administrator may submit the following matters for determination to the agency head if the SBA and the contracting officer fail to agree on them:\
(1) The decision not to make a particular acquisition available for award under the 8(a) Program.\
(2) A contracting officer\'92s decision to reject a specific 8(a) participant for award of an 8(a) contract after SBA\'92s acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program.\

Utilization or, for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs.\
(2) SBA must send the written appeal to the agency head within 15 working days of SBA\'92s notification of intent to\
appeal or the appeal may be considered withdrawn. Pending issuance of a decision by the agency head, the contracting officer shall suspend action on the acquisition. The contracting officer need not suspend action on the acquisition if the contracting officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision.\
(c) If the SBA appeal is denied, the decision of the agency head shall specify the reasons for the denial, including the reasons why the selected participant was determined incapable of performance, if appropriate. The decision shall be made a part of the contract file.\

\f0\b 19.811 Preparing the contracts.\
19.811-1 Sole source.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contract to be awarded by the agency to the SBA shall be prepared in accordance with agency procedures\
and in the same detail as would be required in a contract with a business concern. The contracting officer shall use the \cf3 Standard Form 26 \cf4 as the award form, except for construction contracts, in which case the \cf3 Standard Form 1442 \cf4 shall be used as required in \cf3 36.701\cf4 (a).\
(b) The contracting officer shall prepare the contract that the SBA will award to the 8(a) participant in accordance with agency procedures, as if awarding the contract directly to the 8(a) participant, except for the following:\

(4) The SBA will obtain the signature of the 8(a) contractor prior to signing and returning the prime contract to the contracting officer for signature. The SBA will make every effort to obtain signatures and return the contract, and any subsequent bilateral modification, to the contracting officer within a maximum of 10 working days.\
(c) Except in procurements where the SBA will make advance payments to its 8(a) contractor, the agency contracting officer may, as an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, use a single contract document for both the prime contract between the agency and the SBA and its 8(a) contractor. The single contract document shall contain the information in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection. Appropriate blocks on the \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 26 \cf4 or 1442 will be asterisked and a continuation sheet appended as a tripartite agreement which includes the following:\
(1) Agency acquisition office, prime contract number, name of agency contracting officer and lines for signature, date signed, and effective date.\
(2) The SBA office, the SBA contract number, name of the SBA contracting officer, and lines for signature and date signed.\

(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.219-12\cf4 , Special 8(a) Subcontract Conditions, in contracts between the SBA and its 8(a) contractor when the acquisition is accomplished using the procedures of \cf3 19.811-1\cf4 (a) and (b).\

(d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.219-18\cf4 , Notification of Competition Limited to Eligible 8(a) Participants, in competitive solicitations and contracts when the acquisition is accomplished using the procedures of \cf3 19.805\cf4 . Use the clause at \cf3 52.219-18 \cf4 with its Alternate I when competition is to be limited to 8(a) participants within one or more specific SBA districts pursuant to \cf3 19.804-2\cf4 .\
(e) For contracts or orders resulting from this subpart, see \cf3 19.507\cf4 (e) for use of \cf3 52.219-14\cf4 , Limitations on Subcontracting, and \cf3 19.507\cf4 (h) for use of \cf3 52.219-33\cf4 , Nonmanufacturer Rule.\

\f0\b 19.812 Contract administration.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall assign contract administration functions, as required, based on the location of the 8(a) contractor (see Federal Directory of Contract Administration Services Components (available via the Internet at \cf3 https:// piee.eb.mil/pcm/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml \cf4 )).\
(b) The agency shall distribute copies of the contract(s) in accordance with \cf3 part 4\cf4 . All contracts and modifications, if any, shall be distributed to both the SBA and the 8(a) contractor in accordance with the timeframes set forth in \cf3 4.201\cf4 .\
(c) To the extent consistent with the contracting activity\'92s capability and resources, 8(a) contractors furnishing requirements shall be afforded production and technical assistance, including, when appropriate, identification of causes of deficiencies in their products and suggested corrective action to make such products acceptable.\
(d) For 8(a) contracts exceeding 5 years including options, the contracting officer shall verify in DSBS or SAM that the concern is an SBA-certified 8(a) participant no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract. If the concern is not an SBA-certified 8(a) participant, the contracting officer shall not exercise the option (see \cf3 13 CFR 124.521(e) (2)\cf4 ).\
(e) An 8(a) contract, whether in the base or an option year, must be terminated for convenience if the 8(a) contractor to which it was awarded transfers ownership or control of the firm or if the contract is transferred or novated for any reason\
to another firm, unless the Administrator of the SBA waives the requirement for contract termination (13 CFR 124.515).\
The Administrator may waive the termination requirement only if certain conditions exist. Moreover, a waiver of the requirement for termination is permitted only if the 8(a) contractor's request for waiver is made to the SBA prior to the\
actual relinquishment of ownership or control, except in the case of death or incapacity where the waiver must be submitted within 60 calendar days after such an occurrence. The clauses in the contract entitled "Special 8(a) Contract Conditions"\
and "Special 8(a) Subcontract Conditions" require the SBA and the 8(a) subcontractor to notify the contracting officer\
when ownership of the firm is being transferred. When the contracting officer receives information that an 8(a) contractor is planning to transfer ownership or control to another firm, the contracting officer shall take action immediately to preserve the option of waiving the termination requirement. The contracting officer shall determine the timing of the proposed transfer and its effect on contract performance and mission support. If the contracting officer determines that the SBA does not intend to waive the termination requirement, and termination of the contract would severely impair attainment of the agency's program objectives or mission, the contracting officer shall immediately notify the SBA in writing that the agency is requesting a waiver. Within 15 business days thereafter, or such longer period as agreed to by the agency and the SBA, the agency head must either confirm or withdraw the request for waiver. Unless a waiver is approved by the SBA, the contracting officer must\

\fs20 terminate the contract for convenience upon receipt of a written request by the SBA. This requirement for a convenience termination does not affect the Government's right to terminate for default if the cause for termination of an 8(a) contract is other than the transfer of ownership or control.\

\f0\b 19.813 Protesting an 8(a) participant's eligibility or size status.\

\f1\b0 (a) The eligibility of an 8(a) participant for a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement may not be challenged by another 8(a) participant or any other party, either to SBA or any administrative forum as part of a bid or other contract protest (see 13 CFR 124.517).\
(b) The size status of an 8(a) participant nominated for an 8(a) sole source contract may not be protested by another 8(a) participant or any other party.\
(c) The size status of the apparent successful offeror for competitive 8(a) awards may be protested. The filing of a size status protest is limited to-\
(1) Any offeror whom the contracting officer has not eliminated for reasons unrelated to size;\
(2) The contracting officer; or\
(3) The SBA District Director in either the district office serving the geographical area in which the contracting activity\
is located or the district office that services the apparent successful offeror, or the Associate Administrator for Business Development.\
(d) Protests of competitive 8(a) awards shall follow the procedures at \cf3 19.302\cf4 . For additional information, refer to 13 CFR 121.1001.\

\f0\b 19.814 Requesting a formal size determination (8(a) sole source requirements).\

\f1\b0 (a) If the size status of an 8(a) participant nominated for award of an 8(a) sole source contract is called into question, a request for a formal size determination may be submitted to SBA pursuant to 13 CFR 121.1001(b)(2)(ii) by-\
(1) The 8(a) participant nominated for award of the particular sole source contract;\
(2) The contracting officer who has been delegated SBA\'92s 8(a) contract execution functions, where applicable, or the SBA program official with authority to execute the 8(a) contract;\
(3) The SBA District Director in the district office that services the 8(a) participant or the Associate Administrator for Business Development; or\
(4) The SBA Inspector General.\
(b) SBA\'92s Government Contracting Area Director will issue a formal size determination within 15 business days, if\
possible, after SBA receives the request for a formal size determination.\
(c) An appeal of an SBA size determination shall follow the procedures at \cf3 19.302\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.815 Release and notification requirements for non-8(a) procurement.\

\f1\b0 (a) Once a requirement has been accepted by SBA into the 8(a) program, any follow-on requirements (see definition at \cf3 13 CFR 124.3\cf4 ) shall remain in the 8(a) program unless\'97\
(1) SBA agrees to release the requirement from the 8(a) program for a follow-on, non-8(a) procurement in accordance with \cf3 13 CFR 124.504(d) \cf4 (see paragraph (b) of this section); or\
(2) There is a mandatory source (see \cf3 8.002 \cf4 or \cf3 8.003\cf4 ; also see paragraph (f) of this section).\
(b) To obtain release of a requirement for a follow-on, non-8(a) procurement, (other than a mandatory source listed at\
\cf3 8.002 \cf4 or \cf3 8.003\cf4 ), the contracting officer shall make a written request to, and receive concurrence from, the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development.\
(c) (1) The written request to the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development shall indicate\
(i) Whether the agency has achieved its small disadvantaged business goal;\
(ii) Whether the agency has achieved its HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, or small business goal(s); and\
(iii) Whether the requirement is critical to the business development of the 8(a) contractor that is currently\
performing the requirement.\
(2) Generally, a requirement that was previously accepted into the 8(a) program will only be released for procurements\
outside the 8(a) program when the contracting activity agency agrees to set aside the requirement under the small business, HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs.\
(3) The requirement that a follow-on procurement must be released from the 8(a) program in order for it to be fulfilled outside the 8(a) program does not apply to task or delivery orders offered to and accepted into the 8(a) program, where the basic contract was not accepted into the 8(a) program.\

\f1\b0 (d) (1) When a contracting officer decides that a requirement previously procured under the 8(a) program is a new requirement and not a follow-on requirement to an 8(a) contract(s), the contracting officer shall coordinate with and submit a written notice to the SBA District Office servicing the 8(a) incumbent firm and to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) indicating that the agency intends to procure the requirement outside the 8(a) program (see \cf3 19.810\cf4 (a)(4)).\
(2) The written notice shall include a copy of the acquisition plan, if available; the performance work statement (PWS), statement of work (SOW), or statement of objectives (SOO) for the new contract requirement; and the values of the existing 8(a) contract(s) and the new contract requirement.\
(e) (1) When a contracting officer decides to procure a follow-on requirement to an 8(a) contract using an existing, limited competition contracting vehicle that is not available to all 8(a) participants, and the current or previous 8(a) contract was available to all 8(a) participants, the contracting officer shall coordinate with and submit a written notice to the SBA District Office servicing the 8(a) incumbent firm and to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see \cf3 19.402\cf4 (a)) indicating the intent to do so.\
(2) The written notice shall include a copy of the acquisition plan, if available; the PWS, SOW, or SOO for the new contract requirement; and the values of both contracts.\
(f) (1) When a mandatory source will be used for a follow-on requirement to an 8(a) contract, the contracting officer should submit a written notice to the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development of the intent to do so at least 30 days prior to the end of the contract or order in accordance with \cf3 13 CFR 124.504(d)(4)(ii)\cf4 .\
(2) The written notice should include a written determination that a mandatory source will be used to fulfill the requirement.\

\f0\b 19.816 Exiting the 8(a) program.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, when a contractor exits the 8(a) program, it is no longer eligible to receive new 8(a) contracts. However, the contractor remains under contractual obligation to complete existing contracts, and any priced options that may be exercised.\
(b) If an 8(a) contractor is suspended from the program (see 13 CFR 124.305), it may not receive any new 8(a) contracts unless the head of the contracting agency makes a determination that it is in the best interest of the Government to issue the award and SBA adopts that determination.\
(c) A contractor that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program may be awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was an 8(a) participant eligible for award of the contract on the initial date specified for receipt of offers contained in the solicitation, and if the contractor continues to meet all other applicable eligibility criteria (see \cf3 13 CFR 124.507(d)\cf4 ).\
(d) SBA's regulations on exiting the 8(a) program are found at 13 CFR 124.301 through 124.305, and 13 CFR 124.507(d).\

(c) An economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concern and a WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program are subcategories of \'93women-owned small business concern\'94 as defined in section \cf3 2.101\cf4 .\

(b) For a WOSB that seeks a WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source contract, the contracting officer shall verify that the offeror\'97\
(1) Is registered in the System for Award Management (SAM); and\
(2) Is designated as a certified EDWOSB or WOSB concern in SAM (see 19.1505(d) for set aside procedures). Pending applications for certification are only in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) at 
\f2\i \cf3 https://web.sba.gov/pro-net/search/ dsp_dsbs.cfm\cf4 .\

\f1\i0 (c) If there is a decision issued by SBA as a result of a current eligibility examination finding that the concern did not qualify as an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program, the contracting officer may terminate the contract, and shall not exercise any option, or award further task or delivery orders. Agencies shall not count or include the award toward the small business goals for an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program and must update FPDS from the date of award to reflect the final SBA decision.\
(d) A joint venture may be considered an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program if the EDWOSB or WOSB participant is certified in SAM (see section 19.1505(d) for set-aside procedures) and the joint venture meets the requirements of \cf3 13 CFR 127.506\cf4 .\

\f0\b 19.1504 Exclusions.\

(3) The contracting officer shall not make award to an offeror who is not a certified EDWOSB or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB program.\
(g) The contracting officer may make an award, if only one acceptable offer is received from a qualified EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program.\
(h) If no acceptable offers are received from an EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, must be considered for set aside in accordance with \cf3 19.203 \cf4 and subpart \cf3 19.5\cf4 .\

(4) Within 15 business days of SBA\'92s notification to the head of the contracting activity, SBA shall file a formal appeal to the head of the agency, or the appeal will be determined withdrawn; and\
(5) The head of the agency, or designee, shall specify in writing the reasons for a denial of an appeal brought under this section.\

22.101-1 General.\

\fs24 Subpart 22.1 - Basic Labor Policies\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) Agencies shall maintain sound relations with industry and labor to ensure (1) prompt receipt of information involving labor relations that may adversely affect the Government acquisition process and (2) that the Government obtains needed supplies and services without delay. All matters regarding labor relations shall be handled in accordance with agency procedures.\
(b) (1) Agencies shall remain impartial concerning any dispute between labor and contractor management and not undertake the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of a labor dispute. To the extent practicable, agencies should ensure that the parties to the dispute use all available methods for resolving the dispute, including the services of the National Labor Relations Board, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the National Mediation Board and other appropriate Federal, State, local, or private agencies.\
(2) For use of project labor agreements, see subpart \cf3 22.5\cf4 .\
(c) Agencies should, when practicable, exchange information concerning labor matters with other affected agencies to\
ensure a uniform Government approach concerning a particular plant or labor-management dispute.\
(d) Agencies should take other actions concerning labor relations problems to the extent consistent with their acquisition\
responsibilities. For example, agencies should-\
(1) Notify the agency responsible for conciliation, mediation, arbitration, or other related action of the existence of any\
labor dispute affecting or threatening to affect agency acquisition programs;\
(2) Furnish to the parties to a dispute factual information pertinent to the dispute\'92s potential or actual adverse impact on\
these programs, to the extent consistent with security regulations; and\

\f1\b0 F

\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (3) Seek a voluntary agreement between management and labor, notwithstanding the continuance of the dispute, to permit uninterrupted acquisition of supplies and services. This shall only be done, however, if the attempt to obtain voluntary agreement does not involve the agency in the merits of the dispute and only after consultation with the agency responsible for conciliation, mediation, arbitration, or other related action.\
(e) The head of the contracting activity may designate programs or requirements for which it is necessary that contractors be required to notify the Government of actual or potential labor disputes that are delaying or threaten to delay the timely contract performance (see \cf3 22.103-5\cf4 (a)).\

\f0\b 22.101-2 Contract pricing and administration.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contractor labor policies and compensation practices, whether or not included in labor-management agreements, are not acceptable bases for allowing costs in cost-reimbursement contracts or for recognition of costs in pricing fixed-price contracts if they result in unreasonable costs to the Government. For a discussion of allowable costs resulting from labor- management agreements, see \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 (b).\
(b) Labor disputes may cause work stoppages that delay the performance of Government contracts. Contracting\
officers shall impress upon contractors that each contractor shall be held accountable for reasonably avoidable delays. Standard contract clauses dealing with default, excusable delays, etc., do not relieve contractors or subcontractors from the responsibility for delays that are within the contractors\'92 or their subcontractors\'92 control. A delay caused by a strike that the contractor or subcontractor could not reasonably prevent can be excused; however, it cannot be excused beyond the point at which a reasonably diligent contractor or subcontractor could have acted to end the strike by actions such as-\
(1) Filing a charge with the National Labor Relations Board to permit the Board to seek injunctive relief in court; (2) Using other available Government procedures; and\
(3) Using private boards or organizations to settle disputes.\
(c) Strikes normally result in changing patterns of cost incurrence and therefore may have an impact on the allowability of costs for cost-reimbursement contracts or for recognition of costs in pricing fixed-price contracts. Certain costs may increase because of strikes; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 guard services and attorney\'92s fees. Other costs incurred during a strike may not fluctuate (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 "fixed costs" such as rent and depreciation), but because of reduced production, their proportion of the unit cost of items produced increases. All costs incurred during strikes shall be carefully examined to ensure recognition of only those costs necessary for performing the contract in accordance with the Government\'92s essential interest.\
(d) If, during a labor dispute, the inspectors\'92 safety is not endangered, the normal functions of inspection at the plant of a Government contractor shall be continued without regard to the existence of a labor dispute, strike, or picket line.\

\f0\b 22.101-3 Reporting labor disputes.\

\f1\b0 The office administering the contract shall report, in accordance with agency procedures, any potential or actual labor disputes that may interfere with performing any contracts under its cognizance. If a contract contains the clause at \cf3 52.222-1\cf4 , Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes, the contractor also must report any actual or potential dispute that may delay contract performance.\

\f0\b 22.101-4 Removal of items from contractors\'92 facilities affected by work stoppages.\

\f1\b0 (a) Items shall be removed from contractors\'92 facilities affected by work stoppages in accordance with agency procedures. Agency procedures should allow for the following:\
(1) Determine whether removal of items is in the Government\'92s interest. Normally the determining factor is the critical needs of an agency program.\
(2) Attempt to arrange with the contractor and the union representative involved their approval of the shipment of urgently required items.\
(3) Obtain appropriate approvals from within the agency.\
(4) Determine who will remove the items from the plant(s) involved.\
(b) Avoid the use or appearance of force and prevent incidents that might detrimentally affect labor-management relations. (c) When two or more agencies\'92 requirements are or may become involved in the removal of items, the contract\
administration office shall ensure that the necessary coordination is accomplished.\

 22.102 Federal and State labor requirements.\
22.102-1 Policy.\

\f1\b0 Agencies shall cooperate, and encourage contractors to cooperate with Federal and State agencies responsible for enforcing labor requirements such as-\
(a) Safety;\
(b) Health and sanitation;\
(c) Maximum hours and minimum wages;\
(d) Equal employment opportunity;\
(e) Child and convict labor;\
(f) Age discrimination;\
(g) Disabled and Vietnam veteran employment;\
(h) Employment of workers with disabilities; and\
(i) Eligibility for employment under United States immigration laws.\

\f0\b 22.102-2 Administration.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall cooperate with, and encourage contractors to use to the fullest extent practicable, the DOL Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA) at \cf3 http://www.doleta.gov\cf4 , and its affiliated local offices in meeting contractors' labor requirements. These requirements may be to staff new or expanding plant facilities, including requirements for workers in all occupations and skills from local labor market areas or through the Federal-State employment clearance system.\
(b) Local State employment offices are operated throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to providing recruitment assistance to contractors, cooperation with the local State Employment Service offices will further the national program of maintaining continuous assessment of manpower requirements and resources on a national and local basis.\
(c) (1) The U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administration and enforcement of numerous wage and hour statutes including-\
(i) \cf3 40 U.S.C. chapter 31\cf4 , subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction);\
(ii) \cf3 40 U.S.C. chapter 37\cf4 , Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards;\
(iii) The Copeland Act (\cf3 18 U.S.C. 874 \cf4 and \cf3 40 U.S.C. 3145\cf4 );\
(iv) \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 65\cf4 , Contracts for Materials, Supplies, Articles, and Equipment Exceeding $10,000; (v) \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 67\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards.\
(2) Contracting officers should contact the Wage and Hour Division\'92s regional offices when required by the subparts relating to these statutes unless otherwise specified. Addresses for these offices may be found at 29 CFR 1, Appendix B.\

\f0\b 22.103 Overtime.\
22.103-1 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Normal workweek
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means, generally, a workweek of 40 hours. Outside the United States and its outlying areas, a workweek longer than 40 hours is considered normal if-\
(1) The workweek does not exceed the norm for the area, as determined by local custom, tradition, or law; and (2) The hours worked in excess of 40 in the workweek are not compensated at a premium rate of pay.\

\f0\b 22.103-2 Policy.\

\f1\b0 Contractors shall perform all contracts, so far as practicable, without using overtime, particularly as a regular employment practice, except when lower overall costs to the Government will result or when it is necessary to meet urgent program needs. Any approved overtime, extra-pay shifts, and multishifts should be scheduled to achieve these objectives.\

\f0\b 22.103-3 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Solicitations normally shall not specify delivery or performance schedules that may require overtime at Government expense.\
(b) In negotiating contracts, contracting officers should, consistent with the Government\'92s needs, attempt to- (1) Ascertain the extent that offers are based on the payment of overtime and shift premiums; and\

\fs20 (2) Negotiate contract prices or estimated costs without these premiums or obtain the requirement from other sources. (c) When it becomes apparent during negotiations of applicable contracts (see \cf3 22.103-5\cf4 (b)) that overtime will be required\
in contract performance, the contracting officer shall secure from the contractor a request for all overtime to be used during the life of the contract, to the extent that the overtime can be estimated with reasonable certainty. The contractor\'92s request shall contain the information required by paragraph (b) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-2\cf4 , Payment for Overtime Premiums.\

\f0\b 22.103-4 Approvals.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall review the contractor\'92s request for overtime. Approval of the use of overtime may be granted by an agency approving official after determining in writing that overtime is necessary to-\
(1) Meet essential delivery or performance schedules;\
(2) Make up for delays beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor; or\
(3) Eliminate foreseeable extended production bottlenecks that cannot be eliminated in any other way.\
(b) Approval by the designated official of use and total dollar amount of overtime is required before inclusion of an amount in paragraph (a) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-2\cf4 , Payment for Overtime Premiums.\
(c) Contracting officer approval of payment of overtime premiums is required for time-and-materials and labor-hour contracts (see paragraph (a)(8) of the clause at \cf3 52.232-7\cf4 , Payments Under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts).\
(d) No approvals are required for paying overtime premiums under other types of contracts.\
(e) Approvals by the agency approving official (see \cf3 22.103-4\cf4 (a)) may be for an individual contract, project, program, plant, division, or company, as practical.\
(f) During contract performance, contractor requests for overtime exceeding the amount authorized by paragraph (a) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-2\cf4 , Payment for Overtime Premiums, shall be submitted as stated in paragraph (b) of the clause to the office administering the contract. That office will review the request and if it approves, send the request to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer determines that the requested overtime should be approved in whole or in part, the contracting officer shall request the approval of the agency\'92s designated approving official and modify paragraph (a) of the clause to reflect any approval.\
(g) Overtime premiums at Government expense should not be approved when the contractor is already obligated, without the right to additional compensation, to meet the required delivery date.\
(h) When the use of overtime is authorized under a contract, the office administering the contract and the auditor should periodically review the use of overtime to ensure that it is allowable in accordance with the criteria in \cf3 part 31\cf4 . Only overtime premiums for work in those departments, sections, etc., of the contractor\'92s plant that have been individually evaluated and the necessity for overtime confirmed shall be considered for approval.\
(i) Approvals for using overtime shall ordinarily be prospective, but, if justified by emergency circumstances, approvals may be retroactive.\

\f0\b 22.103-5 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-1\cf4 , Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes, in solicitations and contracts that involve programs or requirements that have been designated under \cf3 22.101-1\cf4 (e).\
(b) The contracting officer shall include the clause at \cf3 52.222-2\cf4 , Payment for Overtime Premiums, in solicitations and contracts when a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated and the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold; unless-\
(1) A cost-reimbursement contract for operation of vessels is contemplated; or\
(2) A cost-plus- incentive-fee contract that will provide a swing from the target fee of at least plus or minus 3 percent and a contractor\'92s share of at least 10 percent is contemplated.\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) Executive Order11755, December 29,1973, as amended by Executive Order12608, September 9,1987, and Executive Order12943, December 13,1994, states: "The development of the occupational and educational skills of prison inmates is essential to their rehabilitation and to their ability to make an effective return to free society. Meaningful employment serves to develop those skills. It is also true, however, that care must be exercised to avoid either the exploitation of convict labor or any unfair competition between convict labor and free labor in the production of goods and services." The Executive order does not prohibit the contractor, in performing the contract, from employing-\
(1) Persons on parole or probation;\
(2) Persons who have been pardoned or who have served their terms;\
(3) Federal prisoners; or\
(4) Nonfederal prisoners authorized to work at paid employment in the community under the laws of a jurisdiction\
listed in the Executive order if-\
(i) The worker is paid or is in an approved work training program on a voluntary basis;\
(ii) Representatives of local union central bodies or similar labor union organizations have been consulted; (iii) Paid employment will not-\
(A) Result in the displacement of employed workers;\
(B) Be applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality; or (C) Impair existing contracts for services;\
(iv) The rates of pay and other conditions of employment will not be less than those for work of a similar nature in the locality where the work is being performed; and\
(v) The Attorney General of the United States has certified that the work-release laws or regulations of the jurisdiction involved are in conformity with the requirements of Executive Order11755, as amended.\
(b) Department of Justice regulations authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to exercise the power and authority vested in the Attorney General by the Executive order to certify and to revoke the certification of work-release laws or regulations (see 28 CFR0.94-1(b)).\

\f0\b 22.202 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 Insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-3\cf4 , Convict Labor, in solicitations and contracts above the micro-purchase threshold, when the contract will be performed in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; unless-\
(a) The contract will be subject to \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 65\cf4 , (see \cf3 subpart 22.6\cf4 ), which contains a separate prohibition against the employment of convict labor;\
(b) The supplies or services are to be purchased from Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (see \cf3 subpart 8.6\cf4 ); or\
(c) The acquisition involves the purchase, from any State prison, of finished supplies that may be secured in the open market or from existing stocks, as distinguished from supplies requiring special fabrication.\

\fs24 Subpart 22.3 - Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act\

\fs20 22.300 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for applying the requirements of \cf3 40 U.S.C.chapter 37\cf4 , Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards (the statute) to contracts that may require or involve laborers or mechanics. In this subpart, the term "laborers or mechanics" includes apprentices, trainees, helpers, watchmen, guards, firefighters, fireguards, and workmen who perform services in connection with dredging or rock excavation in rivers or harbors, but does not include any employee employed as a seaman.\

\f0\b 22.301 Statutory requirement.\

\f1\b0 The statute requires that certain contracts contain a clause specifying that no laborer or mechanic doing any part of the work contemplated by the contract shall be required or permitted to work more than 40 hours in any workweek unless paid for all such overtime hours at not less than 1 1/2 times the basic rate of pay.\

\f0\b 22.302 Liquidated damages and overtime pay.\

\f1\b0 (a) When an overtime computation discloses underpayments, the responsible contractor or subcontractor must pay the affected employee any unpaid wages and pay liquidated damages to the Government. The contracting officer must assess liquidated damages at the rate specified at 29 CFR \cf3 5.5\cf4 (b)(2) per affected employee for each calendar day on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime wages required by the statute. In accordance with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 Note), the Department of Labor adjusts this civil monetary penalty for inflation no later than January 15 each year.\
(b) If the contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with overtime pay requirements of the statute and the funds withheld by Federal agencies for labor standards violations do not cover the unpaid wages due laborers and mechanics and the liquidated damages due the Government, make payments in the following order\'97\
(1) Pay laborers and mechanics the wages they are owed (or prorate available funds if they do not cover the entire amount owed); and\
(2) Pay liquidated damages.\
(c) If the head of an agency finds that the administratively determined liquidated damages due under paragraph (a) of this\
section are incorrect, or that the contractor or subcontractor inadvertently violated the statute despite the exercise of due care, the agency head may-\
(1) Reduce the amount of liquidated damages assessed for liquidated damages of $500 or less;\
(2) Release the contractor or subcontractor from the liability for liquidated damages of $500 or less; or (3) Recommend that the Secretary of Labor reduce or waive liquidated damages over $500.\

\f1\b0 there, the requirements of this subpart are applicable for the actual time so spent, not including travel unless the employees transport materials or supplies to or from the site of the work.\
(b) Nonconstruction contracts involving some construction work. (1) The requirements of this subpart apply to construction work to be performed as part of nonconstruction contracts (supply, service, research and development, etc.) if-\
(i) The construction work is to be performed on a public building or public work;\
(ii) The contract contains specific requirements for a substantial amount of construction work exceeding the monetary threshold for application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute (the word "substantial" relates to the type and quantity of construction work to be performed and not merely to the total value of construction work as compared to the total value of the contract); and\
(iii) The construction work is physically or functionally separate from, and is capable of being performed on a segregated basis from, the other work required by the contract.\
(2) The requirements of this subpart do not apply if-\
(i) The construction work is incidental to the furnishing of supplies, equipment, or services (for example, the\
requirements do not apply to simple installation or alteration at a public building or public work that is incidental to furnishing supplies or equipment under a supply contract; however, if a substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, or repair is required, such as for installation of heavy generators or large refrigerator systems or for plant modification or rearrangement, the requirements of this subpart apply); or\
(ii) The construction work is so merged with non- construction work or so fragmented in terms of the locations or time spans in which it is to be performed, that it is not capable of being segregated as a separate contractual requirement.\

\f0\b 22.403 Statutory, Executive Order, and regulatory requirements.\
22.403-1 Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute.\

\f1\b0 \cf3 40 U.S.C. chapter 31\cf4 , subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act, provides that contracts in excess of $2,000 to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party for construction, alteration, or repair (including painting and decorating) of public buildings or public works within the United States, shall contain a clause (see \cf3 52.222-6\cf4 ) that no laborer or mechanic employed directly upon the site of the work shall receive less than the prevailing wage rates as determined by the Secretary of Labor.\

\f0\b 22.403-2 Copeland Act.\

\f1\b0 The Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act (\cf3 18 U.S.C.874 \cf4 and \cf3 40 U.S.C.3145\cf4 ) makes it unlawful to induce, by force, intimidation, threat of procuring dismissal from employment, or otherwise, any person employed in the construction or\
repair of public buildings or public works, financed in whole or in part by the United States, to give up any part of the compensation to which that person is entitled under a contract of employment. The Copeland Act also requires each contractor and subcontractor to furnish weekly a statement of compliance with respect to the wages paid each employee during the preceding week. Contracts subject to the Copeland Act shall contain a clause (see \cf3 52.222-10\cf4 ) requiring contractors and subcontractors to comply with the regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act.\

\f0\b 22.403-3 Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards.\

\f1\b0 \cf3 40 U.S.C.chpater 37\cf4 , Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards, requires that certain contracts (see \cf3 22.305\cf4 ) contain a clause (see \cf3 52.222-4\cf4 ) specifying that no laborer or mechanic doing any part of the work contemplated by the contract shall be required or permitted to work more than 40 hours in any workweek unless paid for all additional hours at not less than 1 1/2 times the basic rate of pay (see \cf3 22.301\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 22.403-4 Executive Orders 13658 and 14026.\

\f1\b0 Executive Order (E.O.) 13658 established minimum wages for certain workers at $10.10 per hour. The E.O. 13658 rate has increased each year since 2015, rising to $11.25 on January 1, 2022. As of January 30, 2022, E.O. 13658 is superseded by E.O. 14026 to the extent that it is inconsistent with E.O. 14026; the minimum wage rate for certain workers is increased to $15.00 per hour. The wage rate is subject to annual increases by an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor. See \cf3 subpart\
22.19\cf4 . The clause at \cf3 52.222-55\cf4 , Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers under Executive Order 14026, requires the E.O. 14026 minimum wage rate to be paid if it is higher than other minimum wage rates, such as the \cf3 subpart 22.4 \cf4 statutory wage determination amount.\

\f0\b 22.403-6 Department of Labor regulations involving construction.\

\f1\b0 (a) Under the statutes and Executive orders referred to in \cf3 22.403 \cf4 and Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 (3 CFR\
1949-53 Comp., p. 1007), the Secretary of Labor has issued regulations in Title 29, Subtitle A, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribing standards and procedures to be observed by the Department of Labor and the Federal contracting agencies. Those standards and procedures applicable to contracts involving construction are implemented in this subpart.\
(b) The Department of Labor regulations include-\
(1) Part 1, relating to Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute minimum wage rates;\
(2) Part 3, relating to the Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act and requirements for submission of weekly statements of\
compliance and the preservation and inspection of weekly payroll records; (3) Part 5, relating to enforcement of the\'96\
(i) Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute;\

(6) Part 10, relating to establishing a minimum wage for Federal contractors; and\
(7) Part 13, relating to establishing paid sick leave for Federal contractors.\
(c) Refer all questions relating to the application and interpretation of wage determinations (including the classifications\
therein) and the interpretation of the Department of Labor regulations in this subsection to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division.\

\f0\b 22.404 Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 The Department of Labor is responsible for issuing wage determinations reflecting prevailing wages, including fringe benefits. The wage determinations apply only to those laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor upon the site of the work including drivers who transport to or from the site materials and equipment used in the course of contract operations. Determinations are issued for different types of construction, such as building, heavy, highway, and residential (referred to as rate schedules), and apply only to the types of construction designated in the determination.\

\f0\b 22.404-1 Types of wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) General wage determinations. (1) A general wage determination contains prevailing wage rates for the types of construction designated in the determination, and is used in contracts performed within a specified geographical area. General wage determinations contain no expiration date and remain valid until modified, superseded, or canceled by the Department of Labor. Once incorporated in a contract, a general wage determination normally remains effective for the life of the contract, unless the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of the contract (see \cf3 22.404-12\cf4 ). These determinations shall be used whenever possible. They are issued at the discretion of the Department of Labor either upon receipt of an agency request or on the Department of Labor\'92s own initiative.\
(2) General wage determinations are published on the Wage Determinations at SAM.gov website. General wage determinations are effective on the publication date of the wage determination or upon receipt of the wage determination\
by the contracting agency, whichever occurs first. \'93Publication\'94 within the meaning of this section shall occur on the first date the wage determination is published on the Wage Determinations at SAM.gov. Archived Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute general wage determinations that are no longer current may be accessed in the \'93Archived DB WD\'94 database on Wage Determinations at SAM.gov website for information purposes only. Contracting officers may not use an archived wage determination in a contract action without obtaining prior approval of the Department of Labor. To obtain prior approval, contact the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, using \cf3 https://www.sam.gov\cf4 , or contact the procurement agency labor advisor listed on \cf3 https://www.sam.gov\cf4 .\

\f1\b0 (b) 
\f2\i Project wage determinations
\f1\i0 . A project wage determination is issued at the specific request of a contracting agency.\
It is used only when no general wage determination applies, and is effective for 180 calendar days from the date of the determination. However, if a determination expires before contract award, it may be possible to obtain an extension to\
the 180-day life of the determination (see \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (b)(2)). Once incorporated in a contract, a project wage determination normally remains effective for the life of the contract, unless the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of the contract (see \cf3 22.404-12\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 22.404-2 General requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer must incorporate only the appropriate wage determinations in solicitations and contracts and must designate the work to which each determination or part thereof applies. The contracting officer must not include project wage determinations in contracts or options other than those for which they are issued. When exercising an option to extend the term of a contract, the contracting officer must select the most current wage determination(s) from the same schedule(s) as the wage determination(s) incorporated into the contract.\
(b) If the wage determination is a general wage determination or a project wage determination containing more than one rate schedule, the contracting officer shall either include only the rate schedules that apply to the particular types of construction (building, heavy, highway, etc.) or include the entire wage determination and clearly indicate the parts of the work to which each rate schedule shall be applied. Inclusion by reference is not permitted.\
(c) The Wage and Hour Division has issued the following general guidelines for use in selecting the proper schedule(s) of wage rates:\
(1) 
\f2\i Building 
\f1\i0 construction is generally the construction of sheltered enclosures with walk-in access, for housing persons, machinery, equipment, or supplies. It typically includes all construction of such structures, installation of utilities and equipment (both above and below grade level), as well as incidental grading, utilities and paving, unless there is an established area practice to the contrary.\
(2) 
\f2\i Residential 
\f1\i0 construction is generally the construction, alteration, or repair of single family houses or apartment buildings of no more than four (4) stories in height, and typically includes incidental items such as site work, parking areas, utilities, streets and sidewalks, unless there is an established area practice to the contrary.\
(3) 
\f2\i Highway
\f1\i0 construction is generally the construction, alteration, or repair of roads, streets, highways, runways, taxiways, alleys, parking areas, and other similar projects that are not incidental to "building," "residential," or "heavy" construction.\
(4) 
\f2\i Heavy 
\f1\i0 construction includes those projects that are not properly classified as either "building," "residential," or "highway," and is of a catch-all nature. Such heavy projects may sometimes be distinguished on the basis of their individual characteristics, and separate schedules issued (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 ,"dredging," "water and sewer line," "dams," "flood control," etc.).\
(5) When the nature of a project is not clear, it is necessary to look at additional factors, with primary consideration given to locally established area practices. If there is any doubt as to the proper application of wage rate schedules to the type or types of construction involved, guidance shall be sought before the opening of bids, or receipt of best and final offers, from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. Further examples are contained in Department of Labor All Agency Memoranda Numbers 130 and 131.\

\f0\b 22.404-3 Procedures for requesting wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) General wage determinations. If there is a general wage determination on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website applicable to the project, the agency may use it without notifying the Department of Labor. When necessary, a request for a general wage determination may be made by submitting \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 308\cf4 , Request for Determination and Response to Request, to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Attention: Branch of Construction Contract Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210.\
(b) Project wage determinations. If a general wage determination is not available on Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov
\f1\i0 , a contracting agency shall submit requests for project wage determinations on \cf3 SF 308 \cf4 to the Department of Labor. The requests shall include the following information:\
(1) The location, including the county (or other civil subdivision) and State in which the proposed project is located.\
(2) The name of the project and a sufficiently detailed description of the work to indicate the types of construction involved (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 building, heavy, highway, residential, or other type).\
(3) Any available pertinent wage payment information, unless wage patterns in the area are clearly established. (4) The estimated cost of each project.\
(5) All the classifications of laborers and mechanics likely to be employed.\

\fs20 (c) 
\f2\i Time for submission of requests
\f1\i0 . (1) The time required by the Department of Labor for processing requests for project wage determinations varies according to the facts and circumstances in each case. An agency should expect the processing to take at least 30 days. Accordingly, agencies should submit requests for project wage determinations for the primary site of the work to the Department of Labor at least 45 days (60 days if possible) before issuing the solicitation or exercising an option to extend the term of a contract.\
(2) Agencies should promptly submit to the Department of Labor an offeror\'92s request for a project wage determination for a secondary site of the work.\
(d) 
\f2\i Review of wage determinations
\f1\i0 . Immediately upon receipt, the contracting agency shall examine the wage determination and inform the Department of Labor of any changes necessary or appropriate to correct errors. Private parties requesting changes should be advised to submit their requests to the Department of Labor.\

\f0\b 22.404-4 Solicitations issued without wage determinations for the primary site of the work.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a solicitation is issued before the wage determination for the primary site of the work is obtained, a notice shall be included in the solicitation that the schedule of minimum wage rates to be paid under the contract will be issued as an amendment to the solicitation.\
(b) In sealed bidding, bids may not be opened until a reasonable time after the wage determination for the primary site of the work has been furnished to all bidders.\
(c) In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer may open proposals and conduct negotiations before obtaining the wage determination for the primary site of the work. However, the contracting officer shall incorporate the wage determination for the primary site of the work into the solicitation before submission of best and final offers.\

\f0\b 22.404-5 Expiration of project wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall make every effort to ensure that contract award is made before expiration of the project wage determination included in the solicitation.\
(b) The following procedure applies when contracting by sealed bidding:\
(1) If a project wage determination for the primary site of the work expires before bid opening, or if it appears\
before bid opening that a project wage determination may expire before award, the contracting officer shall request a new determination early enough to ensure its receipt before bid opening. If necessary, the contracting officer shall postpone\
the bid opening date to allow a reasonable time to obtain the determination, amend the solicitation to incorporate the new determination, and permit bidders to amend their bids. If the new determination does not change the wage rates and would not warrant amended bids, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the new determination.\
(2) If a project wage determination for the primary site of the work expires after bid opening but before award, the contracting officer shall request an extension of the project wage determination expiration date from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. The request for extension shall be supported by a written finding, which shall include a brief statement\
of factual support, that the extension is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice or undue hardship\
or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business. If necessary, the contracting officer shall delay\
award to permit either receipt of the extension or receipt and processing of a new determination. If the request is granted, the contracting officer shall award the contract and modify it to apply the extended expiration date to the already incorporated project wage determination. (See \cf3 43.103\cf4 (b)(1).) If the request is denied, the Administrator will proceed to issue a new project wage determination. Upon receipt, the contracting officer shall process the new determination as follows:\
(i) If If the new determination for the primary site of the work changes any wage rates for classifications to be used in the contract, the contracting officer may cancel the solicitation only in accordance with \cf3 14.404-1\cf4 . Otherwise the contracting officer shall award the contract and incorporate the new determination to be effective on the date of contract award. The contracting officer shall equitably adjust the contract price for any increased or decreased cost of performance resulting from any changed wage rates.\
(ii) If the new determination for the primary site of the work does not change any wage rates, the contracting officer shall award the contract and modify it to include the number and date of the new determination. (See \cf3 43.103\cf4 (b)(1).)\
(c) The following procedure applies when contracting by negotiation:\
(1) If a project wage determination will or does expire before contract award, the contracting officer shall request a\
new wage determination from the Department of Labor. If necessary, the contracting officer shall delay award while the new determination is obtained and processed.\

\f1\b0 (2) The contracting officer need not delay opening and reviewing proposals or discussing them with the offerors while a new determination for the primary site of the work is being obtained. The contracting officer shall request offerors to extend the period for acceptance of any proposal if that period expires or may expire before receipt and full processing of the new determination.\
(3) If the new determination for the primary site of the work changes any wage rates, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to incorporate the new determination, and furnish the wage rate information to all prospective offerors that were sent a solicitation if the closing date for receipt of proposals has not yet occurred, or to all offerors that have not been eliminated from the competition if the closing date has passed. All offerors to whom wage rate information has been furnished shall be given reasonable opportunity to amend their proposals.\
(4) If the new determination for the primary site of the work does not change any wage rates, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the new determination and award the contract.\

\f0\b 22.404-6 Modifications of wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) General. (1) The Department of Labor may modify a wage determination to make it current by specifying only the items being changed or by reissuing the entire determination with changes incorporated.\
(2) All project wage determination modifications expire on the same day as the original determination. The need to include a modification of a project wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the time of receipt of the modification by the contracting agency. Therefore, the contracting agency must annotate the modification of the project wage determination with the date and time immediately upon receipt.\
(3) The need for inclusion of the modification of a general wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the date the modified wage determination is published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov\

\f1\i0 , or by the date the agency receives actual written notice of the modification from the Department of Labor, whichever occurs first. (Note the distinction between receipt by the agency (modification is effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may occur later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting officer shall monitor the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised. Revisions published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within the timeframes prescribed at \cf3 22.404-6\cf4 (b) and (c) are applicable and must be included in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be accomplished by use of the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website\'92s "Alert Service".\
(b) The following applies when contracting by sealed bidding:\
(1) A written action modifying a wage determination shall be effective if:\
(i) It is received by the contracting agency, or is published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov
\f1\i0 , 10 or more calendar days before the date of bid opening; or\
(ii) It is received by the contracting agency, or is published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 , less than 10 calendar days before the date of bid opening, unless the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time available before bid opening to notify the prospective bidders. (If the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time to notify bidders, a written report of the finding shall be placed in the contract file and shall be made available to the Department of Labor upon request.)\
(2) All written actions modifying wage determinations received by the contracting agency after bid opening, or modifications to general wage determinations published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 after bid opening, shall not be effective and shall not be included in the solicitation (but see paragraph (b)(6) of this subsection).\
(3) If an effective modification of the wage determination for the primary site of the work is received by the contracting officer before bid opening, the contracting officer shall postpone the bid opening, if necessary, to allow a reasonable time to amend the solicitation to incorporate the modification and permit bidders to amend their bids. If the modification does not change the wage rates and would not warrant amended bids, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the modification.\
(4) If an effective modification of the wage determination for the primary site of the work is received by the contracting officer after bid opening, but before award, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures in \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (b)(2)(i) or (ii).\
(5) If an effective modification is received by the contracting officer after award, the contracting officer shall modify the contract to incorporate the wage modification retroactive to the date of award and equitably adjust the contract price for any increased or decreased cost of performance resulting from any changed wage rates. If the modification does not change any wage rates and would not warrant contract price adjustment, the contracting officer shall modify the contract to include the number and date of the modification.\

\fs20 (6) If an award is not made within 90 days after bid opening, any modification to a general wage determination which is published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 before award, shall be effective for any resultant contract unless an extension of the 90-day period is obtained from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. An agency head may request such an extension from the Administrator. The request must be supported by a written finding, which shall include a brief statement of factual support, that the extension is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice, undue hardship, or to avoid serious impairment in the conduct of Government business. The contracting officer shall follow the procedures in \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (b)(2).\
(c) The following applies when contracting by negotiation:\
(1) All written actions modifying wage determinations received by the contracting agency before contract award, or\
modifications to general wage determinations published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 before award, shall be effective.\
(2) If an effective wage modification is received by the contracting officer before award, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures in \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (c)(3) or (4).\
(3) If an effective wage modification is received by the contracting officer after award, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures in \cf3 22.404-6\cf4 (b)(5).\
(d) The following applies when modifying a contract to exercise an option to extend the term of a contract: (1) A modified wage determination is effective if-\
(i) The contracting agency receives a written action from the Department of Labor prior to exercise of the option, or within 45 days after submission of a wage determination request (\cf3 22.404-3\cf4 (c)), whichever is later; or\
(ii) The Department of Labor publishes the modification to a general wage determination on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 before exercise of the option.\
(2) If the contracting officer receives an effective modified wage determination either before or after execution of the contract modification to exercise the option, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the modified wage determination, and any changed wage rates, effective as of the date that the option to extend was effective.\

\f0\b 22.404-7 Correction of wage determinations containing clerical errors.\

\f1\b0 Upon the Department of Labor\'92s own initiative or at the request of the contracting agency, the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, may correct any wage determination found to contain clerical errors. Such corrections will be effective immediately, and will apply to any solicitation or active contract. Before contract award, the contracting officer must follow the procedures in \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (b)(1) or (2)(i) or (ii) in sealed bidding, and the procedures in \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (c)(3) or (4) in negotiations. After contract award, the contracting officer must follow the procedures at \cf3 22.404-6\cf4 (b)(5), except that for contract modifications to exercise an option to extend the term of the contract, the contracting officer must follow the procedures at \cf3 22.404-6\cf4 (d)(2).\

\f0\b 22.404-8 Notification of improper wage determination before award.\

\f1\b0 (a) The following written notifications by the Department of Labor shall be effective immediately without regard to \cf3 22.404-6 \cf4 if received by the contracting officer prior to award:\
(1) A solicitation includes the wrong wage determination or the wrong rate schedule; or\
(2) A wage determination is withdrawn by the Administrative Review Board.\
(b) In sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall proceed in accordance with the following:\
(1) If the notification of an improper wage determination for the primary site of the work reaches the contracting officer before bid opening, the contracting officer shall postpone the bid opening date, if necessary, to allow a reasonable time to-\
(i) Obtain the appropriate determination if a new wage determination is required;\
(ii) Amend the solicitation to incorporate the determination (or rate schedule); and\
(iii) Permit bidders to amend their bids. If the appropriate wage determination does not change any wage rates and\
would not warrant amended bids, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the new determination.\
(2) If the notification of an improper wage determination for the primary site of the work reaches the contracting officer after bid opening but before award, the contracting officer shall delay awarding the contract, if necessary, and if required, obtain the appropriate wage determination. The appropriate wage determination shall be processed in accordance with \cf3 22.404-5\cf4 (b)(2)(i) or (ii).\

\f0\b 22.404-9 Award of contract without required wage determination.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a contract is awarded without the required wage determination (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 incorporating no determination, containing a clearly inapplicable general wage determination, or containing a project determination which is inapplicable because of an inaccurate description of the project or its location), the contracting officer shall initiate action to incorporate the required determination in the contract immediately upon discovery of the error. If a required wage determination (valid determination in effect on the date of award) is not available, the contracting officer shall expeditiously request a wage determination from the Department of Labor, including a statement explaining the circumstances and giving the date of the contract award.\
(b) The contracting officer shall-\
(1) Modify the contract to incorporate the required wage determination (retroactive to the date of award) and equitably\
adjust the contract price if appropriate; or (2) Terminate the contract.\

\f0\b 22.404-10 Posting wage determinations and notice.\

\f1\b0 The contractor must keep a copy of the applicable wage determination (and any approved additional classifications) posted at the site of the work in a prominent place where the workers can easily see it. The contracting officer shall furnish to the contractor, Department of Labor FormWH-1321, Notice to Employees Working on Federal and Federally Financed Construction Projects, for posting with the wage rates. The name, address, and telephone number of the Government officer responsible for the administration of the contract shall be indicated in the poster to inform workers to whom they may submit complaints or raise questions concerning labor standards.\

\f0\b 22.404-11 Wage determination appeals.\

\f1\b0 The Secretary of Labor has established an Administrative Review Board which decides appeals of final decisions made\
by the Department of Labor concerning Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute wage determinations. A contracting agency or other interested party may file a petition for review under the procedures in 29 CFR Part 7 if reconsideration by the Administrator has been sought pursuant to 29 CFR1.8 and denied.\

\f0\b 22.404-12 Labor standards for contracts containing construction requirements and option provisions that extend the term of the contract.\

\f1\b0 (a) Each time the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of a contract for construction, or a contract that includes substantial and segregable construction work, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the most current wage determination.\
(b) If a contract with an option to extend the term of the contract has indefinite-delivery or indefinite-quantity construction requirements, the contracting officer must incorporate the wage determination incorporated into the contract at the exercise of the option into task orders issued during that option period. The wage determination will be effective for the complete period of performance of those task orders without further revision.\
(c) The contracting officer must include in fixed-price contracts a clause that specifies one of the following methods, suitable to the interest of the Government, to provide an allowance for any increases or decreases in labor costs that result from the inclusion of the current wage determination at the exercise of an option to extend the term of the contract:\
(1) The contracting officer may provide the offerors the opportunity to bid or propose separate prices for each option period. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is used in construction-only contracts (with options to extend the term) that are not expected to exceed a total of 3 years.\
(2) The contracting officer may include in the contract a separately specified pricing method that permits an adjustment to the contract price or contract labor unit price at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. At the time of option exercise, the contracting officer must incorporate a new wage determination into the contract, and must apply\
the specific pricing method to calculate the contract price adjustment. An example of a contract pricing method that the contracting officer might separately specify is incorporation in the solicitation and resulting contract of the pricing data from an annually published unit pricing book 
\f2\i (e.g.
\f1\i0 , the U.S. Army Computer-Aided Cost Estimating System or similar commercial product), which is multiplied in the contract by a factor proposed by the contractor (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , .95 or \cf3 1.1\cf4 ). At option exercise,\

\fs20 the contracting officer incorporates the pricing data from the latest annual edition of the unit pricing book, multiplied by the factor agreed to in the basic contract. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of the new or revised wage determination.\
(3) The contracting officer may provide for a contract price adjustment based solely on a percentage rate determined by the contracting officer using a published economic indicator incorporated into the solicitation and resulting contract. At the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract, the contracting officer will apply the percentage rate, based on the economic indicator, to the portion of the contract price or contract unit price designated in the contract clause as labor costs subject to the provisions of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. The contracting officer must insert 50 percent as the estimated portion of the contract price that is labor unless the contracting officer determines, prior to issuance of the solicitation, that a different percentage is more appropriate for a particular contract or requirement. This percentage adjustment to the designated labor costs must be the only adjustment made to cover increases in wages and/or benefits resulting from the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option.\
(4) The contracting officer may provide a computation method to adjust the contract price to reflect the contractor\'92s actual increase or decrease in wages and fringe benefits (combined) to the extent that the increase is made to comply with, or the decrease is voluntarily made by the contractor as a result of incorporation of, a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is appropriate for use only if contract requirements are predominately services subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the construction requirements are substantial and segregable. The methods used to adjust the contract price for the service requirements and the construction requirements would be similar.\

\f0\b 22.405 [Reserved]\
22.406 Administration and enforcement.\
22.406-1 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . Contracting agencies are responsible for ensuring the full and impartial enforcement of labor standards in the administration of construction contracts. Contracting agencies shall maintain an effective program that shall include-\
(1) Ensuring that contractors and subcontractors are informed, before commencement of work, of their obligations under the labor standards clauses of the contract;\
(2) Adequate payroll reviews, on-site inspections, and employee interviews to determine compliance by the contractor and subcontractors, and prompt initiation of corrective action when required;\
(3) Prompt investigation and disposition of complaints; and\
(4) Prompt submission of all reports required by this subpart.\
(b) 
\f2\i Preconstruction letters and conferences
\f1\i0 . Before construction begins, the contracting officer shall inform the contractor\
of the labor standards clauses and wage determination requirements of the contract and of the contractor\'92s and any subcontractor\'92s responsibilities under the contract. Unless it is clear that the contractor is fully aware of the requirements, the contracting officer shall issue an explanatory letter and/or arrange a conference with the contractor promptly after award of the contract.\

\f0\b 22.406-2 Wages, fringe benefits, and overtime.\

\f1\b0 (a) In computing wages paid to a laborer or mechanic, the contractor may include only the following items:\
(1) Amounts paid in cash to the laborer or mechanic, or deducted from payments under the conditions set forth in 29\
CFR3.5.\
(2) Contributions (except those required by Federal, State, or local law) the contractor makes irrevocably to a trustee or\
a third party under any bona fide plan or program to provide for medical or hospital care, pensions, compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity, unemployment benefits, life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, accident insurance, or any other bona fide fringe benefit.\
(3) Other contributions or anticipated costs for bona fide fringe benefits to the extent expressly approved by the Secretary of Labor.\
(b) (1) The contractor may satisfy the obligation under the clause at \cf3 52.222-6\cf4 , Construction Wage Rate Requirements, by providing wages consisting of any combination of contributions or costs as specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the total cost of the combination is not less than the total of the basic hourly rate and fringe benefits payments prescribed in the wage determination for the classification of laborer or mechanic concerned.\

\f1\b0 (2) Wages provided by the contractor and fringe benefits payments required by the wage determination may include items that are not stated as exact cash amounts. In these cases, the hourly cash equivalent of the cost of these items shall be determined by dividing the employer\'92s contributions or costs by the employee\'92s hours worked during the period covered\
by the costs or contributions. For example, if a contractor pays a monthly health insurance premium of $112 for a particular employee who worked 125 hours during the month, the hourly cash equivalent is determined by dividing $112 by 125 hours, which equals $0.90 per hour. Similarly, the calculation of hourly cash equivalent for nine paid holidays peryear for an employee with a hourly rate of pay of $5.00 is determined by multiplying $5.00 by 72 (9 days at 8 hours each), and dividing the result of $360 by the number of hours worked by the employee during the year. If the interested parties (contractor, contracting officer, and employees or their representative) cannot agree on the cash equivalent, the contracting officer shall submit the question for final determination to the Department of Labor as prescribed by agency procedures. The information submitted shall include-\
(i) A comparison of the payments, contributions, or costs in the wage determination with those made or proposed as equivalents by the contractor; and\
(ii) The comments and recommendations of the contracting officer.\
(c) In computing required overtime payments, (
\f2\i i.e.,
\f1\i0 1 1/2 times the basic hourly rate of pay) the contractor shall use the\
basic hourly rate of pay in the wage determination, or the basic hourly rate actually paid by the contractor, if higher. The basic rate of pay includes employee contributions to fringe benefits, but excludes the contractor\'92s contributions, costs, or payment of cash equivalents for fringe benefits. Overtime shall not be computed on a rate lower than the basic hourly rate in the wage determination.\

\f0\b 22.406-3 Additional classifications.\

\f1\b0 (a) If any laborer or mechanic is to be employed in a classification that is not listed in the wage determination applicable to the contract, the contracting officer, pursuant to the clause at \cf3 52.222-6\cf4 , Construction Wage Rate Requirements, shall require that the contractor submit to the contracting officer, \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 1444\cf4 , Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, which, along with other pertinent data, contains the proposed additional classification and minimum wage rate including any fringe benefits payments.\
(b) Upon receipt of \cf3 SF 1444 \cf4 from the contractor, the contracting officer shall review the request to determine whether it meets the following criteria:\
(1) The classification is appropriate and the work to be performed by the classification is not performed by any classification contained in the applicable wage determination.\
(2) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry.\
(3) The proposed wage rate, including any fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates in the wage determination in the contract.\
(c) (1) If the criteria in paragraph (b) of this subsection are met and the contractor and the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the additional classification (if known) or their representatives agree to the proposed additional classification, and the contracting officer approves, the contracting officer shall submit a report (including a copy of \cf3 SF 1444\cf4 ) of that action to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, for approval, modification, or disapproval of the additional classification and wage rate (including any amount designated for fringe benefits); or\
(2) If the contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification or their representatives, and the contracting officer do not agree on the proposed additional classification, or if the criteria are not met, the contracting officer shall submit a report (including a copy of \cf3 SF 1444\cf4 ) giving the views of all interested parties and the contracting officer\'92s recommendation to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, for determination of appropriate classification and wage rate.\
(d) (1) Within 30 days of receipt of the report, the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, will complete action and so advise the contracting officer, or will notify the contracting officer that additional time is necessary.\
(2) Upon receipt of the Department of Labor\'92s action, the contracting officer shall forward a copy of the action to the contractor, directing that the classification and wage rate be posted in accordance with paragraph (a) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-6 \cf4 and that workers in the affected classification receive no less than the minimum rate indicated from the first day on which work under the contract was performed in the classification.\
(e) In each option to extend the term of the contract, if any laborer or mechanic is to be employed during the option in a classification that is not listed (or no longer listed) on the wage determination incorporated in that option, the contracting officer must require that the contractor submit a request for conformance using the procedures noted in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall review the contractor\'92s employment and payment records of apprentices and trainees made available pursuant to the clause at \cf3 52.222-8\cf4 , Payrolls and Basic Records, to ensure that the contractor has complied with the clause at \cf3 52.222-9\cf4 , Apprentices and Trainees.\
(b) If a contractor has classified employees as apprentices, trainees, or helpers without complying with the requirements of the clause at \cf3 52.222-9\cf4 , the contracting officer shall reject the classification and require the contractor to pay the affected employees at the rates applicable to the classification of the work actually performed.\

\f0\b 22.406-5 Subcontracts.\

\f1\b0 In accordance with the requirements of the clause at \cf3 52.222-11\cf4 , Subcontracts (Labor Standards), the contractor and subcontractors at any tier are required to submit a fully executed \cf3 SF 1413\cf4 , Statement and Acknowledgment, upon award of each subcontract.\

\f0\b 22.406-6 Payrolls and statements.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Submission
\f1\i0 . In accordance with the clause at \cf3 52.222-8\cf4 , Payrolls and Basic Records, the contractor must submit or cause to be submitted, within 7 calendar days after the regular payment date of the payroll week covered, for the contractor and each subcontractor, (1) copies of weekly payrolls applicable to the contract, and (2) weekly payroll statements of compliance. The contractor may use the Department of Labor \cf3 FormWH-347\cf4 , Payroll (For Contractor\'92s Optional Use), or a similar form that provides the same data and identical representation.\
(b) 
\f2\i Withholding for nonsubmission
\f1\i0 . If the contractor fails to submit copies of its or its subcontractors\'92 payrolls\
promptly, the contracting officer shall, from any payment due to the contractor, withhold approval of an amount that the contracting officer considers necessary to protect the interest of the Government and the employees of the contractor or any subcontractor.\
(c) Examination. (1) The contracting officer shall examine the payrolls and payroll statements to ensure compliance with the contract and any statutory or regulatory requirements. Particular attention should be given to-\
(i) The correctness of classifications and rates; (ii) Fringe benefits payments;\
(iii) Hours worked;\
(iv) Deductions; and\
(v) Disproportionate employment ratios of laborers, apprentices or trainees to journeymen.\
(2) Fringe benefits payments, contributions made, or costs incurred on other than a weekly basis shall be considered\
as a part of weekly payments to the extent they are creditable to the particular weekly period involved and are otherwise acceptable.\
(d) 
\f2\i Preservation
\f1\i0 . The contracting agency shall retain payrolls and statements of compliance for 3 years after completion of the contract and make them available when requested by the Department of Labor at any time during that period. Submitted payrolls shall not be returned to a contractor or subcontractor for any reason, but copies thereof may be furnished to the contractor or subcontractor who submitted them, or to a higher tier contractor or subcontractor.\
(e) 
\f2\i Disclosure of payroll records
\f1\i0 . Contractor payroll records in the Government\'92s possession must be carefully protected from any public disclosure which is not required by law, since payroll records may contain information in which the contractor\'92s employees have a privacy interest, as well as information in which the contractor may have a proprietary interest that the Government may be obliged to protect. Questions concerning release of this information may involve the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\

\f0\b 22.406-7 Compliance checking.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall make checks and investigations on all contracts covered by this subpart as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the labor standards requirements of the contract.\
(b) 
\f2\i Regular compliance checks
\f1\i0 . Regular compliance checking includes the following activities:\
(1) Employee interviews to determine correctness of classifications, rates of pay, fringe benefits payments, and hours\
worked. (See \cf3 Standard Form 1445\cf4 .)\
(2) On-site inspections to check type of work performed, number and classification of workers, and fulfillment of\
posting requirements.\
(3) Payroll reviews to ensure that payrolls of prime contractors and subcontractors have been submitted on time and are\

(i) Include all aspects of the contractor\'92s compliance with contract labor standards requirements;\
(ii) Not be limited to specific areas raised in a complaint or uncovered during compliance checks; and (iii) Use personnel familiar with labor laws and their application to contracts.\
(2) Do not disclose contractor employees\'92 oral or written statements taken during an investigation or the employee\'92s identity to anyone other than an authorized Government official without that employee\'92s prior signed consent.\
(3) Send a written request to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, to obtain- (i) Investigation and enforcement instructions; or\
(ii) Available pertinent Department of Labor files.\
(4) Obtain permission from the Department of Labor before disclosing material obtained from Labor Department files, other than computations of back wages and liquidated damages and summaries of back wages due, to anyone other than Government contract administrators.\
(b) 
\f2\i Investigation report. 
\f1\i0 The contracting officer must review the investigation report on receipt and make preliminary findings. The contracting officer normally must not base adverse findings solely on employee statements that the employee does not wish to have disclosed. However, if the investigation establishes a pattern of possible violations that are based on employees\'92 statements that are not authorized for disclosure, the pattern itself may support a finding of noncompliance.\
(c) 
\f2\i Contractor Notification. 
\f1\i0 After completing the review, the contracting officer must-\
(1) Provide the contractor any written preliminary findings and proposed corrective actions, and notice that the\
contractor has the right to request that the basis for the findings be made available and to submit written rebuttal information. (2) Upon request, provide the contractor with rationale for the findings. However, under no circumstances will the\
contracting officer permit the contractor to examine the investigation report. Also, the contracting officer must not disclose the identity of any employee who filed a complaint or who was interviewed, without the prior consent of the employee.\
(3) (i) The contractor may rebut the findings in writing within 60 days after it receives a copy of the preliminary findings. The rebuttal becomes part of the official investigation record. If the contractor submits a rebuttal, evaluate the preliminary findings and notify the contractor of the final findings.\
(ii) If the contracting officer does not receive a timely rebuttal, the contracting officer must consider the preliminary findings final.\
(4) If appropriate, request the contractor to make restitution for underpaid wages and assess liquidated damages. If the request includes liquidated damages, the request must state that the contractor has 60 days to request relief from such assessment.\
(d) 
\f2\i Contracting officer\'92s report. 
\f1\i0 After taking the actions prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection-\
(1) The contracting officer must prepare and forward a report of any violations, including findings and supporting\
evidence, to the agency head. \cf3 Standard Form 1446\cf4 , Labor Standards Investigation Summary Sheet, is the first page of the report; and\
(2) The agency head must process the report as follows:\
(i) The contracting officer must send a detailed enforcement report to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division,\
within 60 days after completion of the investigation, if-\
(A) A contractor or subcontractor underpaid by $1,000 or more;\
(B) The contracting officer believes that the violations are aggravated or willful (or there is reason to believe\
that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors under the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute);\

\fs20 (C) The contractor or subcontractor has not made restitution; or\
(D) Future compliance has not been assured.\
(ii) If the Department of Labor expressly requested the investigation and none of the conditions in paragraph (d)(2)\
(i) of this subsection exist, submit a summary report to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. The report must include- (A) A summary of any violations;\
(B) The amount of restitution paid;\
(C) The number of workers who received restitution;\
(D) The amount of liquidated damages assessed under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute; (E) Corrective measures taken; and\
(F) Any information that may be necessary to review any recommendations for an appropriate adjustment in\
liquidated damages.\
(iii) If none of the conditions in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection are present, close the case and retain\
the report in the appropriate contract file.\
(iv) If substantial evidence is found that violations are willful and in violation of a criminal statute, (generally\
\cf3 18 U.S.C. 874 \cf4 or \cf3 1001\cf4 ), forward the report (supplemented if necessary) to the Attorney General of the United States for prosecution if the facts warrant. Notify the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, when the report is forwarded for the Attorney General\'92s consideration.\
(e) 
\f2\i Department of Labor investigations
\f1\i0 . The Department of Labor will furnish the contracting officer an enforcement report detailing violations found and any corrective action taken by the contractor, in investigations that disclose-\
(1) Underpayments totaling $1,000 or more;\
(2) Aggravated or willful violations (or, when the contracting officer believes that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors under the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute); or\
(3) Potential assessment of liquidated damages under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute.\
(f) 
\f2\i Other investigations
\f1\i0 . The Department of Labor will provide a letter summarizing the findings of the investigation to the\
contracting officer for all investigations that are not described in paragraph (e) of this subsection.\

\f0\b 22.406-9 Withholding from or suspension of contract payments.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Withholding from contract payments
\f1\i0 . If the contracting officer believes a violation exists (see \cf3 22.406-8\cf4 ), or upon request of the Department of Labor, the contracting officer must withhold from payments due the contractor an amount equal to the estimated wage underpayment and estimated liquidated damages due the United States under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute. (See \cf3 22.302\cf4 .)\
(1) If the contracting officer believes a violation exists or upon request of the Department of Labor, the contracting officer must withhold funds from any current Federal contract or Federally assisted contract with the same prime contractor that is subject to either Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute or Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute requirements.\
(2) If a subsequent investigation confirms violations, the contracting officer must adjust the withholding as necessary. However, if the Department of Labor requested the withholding, the contracting officer must not reduce or release the withholding without written approval of the Department of Labor.\
(3) Use withheld funds as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection to satisfy assessed liquidated damages, and unless the contractor makes restitution, validated wage underpayments.\
(b) 
\f2\i Suspension of contract payments
\f1\i0 . If a contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor standards clauses of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute and related statutes, the agency, upon its own action or upon the written request of the Department of Labor, must suspend any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until the violations cease or until the agency has withheld sufficient funds to compensate employees for back wages, and to cover any liquidated damages due.\
(c) Disposition of contract payments withheld or suspended- (1) Forwarding wage underpayments to the Secretary of Labor. Upon final administrative determination, if the contractor or subcontractor has not made restitution, the contracting officer must follow the Department of Labor guidance published in Wage and Hour Division, All Agency Memorandum (AAM) No. 215, Streamlining Claims for Federal Contractor Employees Act. The AAM No. 215 can be obtained at \cf3 http:// www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts/dbra.htm\cf4 ; under Guidance there is a link for All Agencies Memoranda (AAMs).\
(2) 
\f2\i Returning of withheld funds to contractor
\f1\i0 . When funds withheld exceed the amount required to satisfy validated wage underpayments and assessed liquidated damages, return the funds to the contractor.\

\f1\b0 (3) Limitation on returning funds. If the Department of Labor requested the withholding or if the findings are disputed (see \cf3 22.406-10\cf4 (e)), the contracting officer must not return the funds to the contractor without approval by the Department of Labor.\
(4) 
\f2\i Liquidated damages
\f1\i0 . Upon final administrative determination, the contracting officer must dispose of funds withheld or collected for liquidated damages in accordance with agency procedures.\

\f0\b 22.406-10 Disposition of disputes concerning construction contract labor standards enforcement.\

\f1\b0 (a) The areas of possible differences of opinion between contracting officers and contractors in construction contract labor standards enforcement include-\
(1) Misclassification of workers; (2) Hours of work;\
(3) Wage rates and payment;\
(4) Payment of overtime;\
(5) Withholding practices; and\
(6) The applicability of the labor standards requirements under varying circumstances.\
(b) Generally, these differences are settled administratively at the project level by the contracting agency. If necessary,\
these differences may be settled with assistance from the Department of Labor.\
(c) When requesting the contractor to take corrective action in labor violation cases, the contracting officer shall inform\
the contractor of the following:\
(1) Disputes concerning the labor standards requirements of the contract are handled under the contract clause at\
\cf3 52.222-14\cf4 , Disputes Concerning Labor Standards, and not under the clause at \cf3 52.233-1\cf4 , Disputes.\
(2) The contractor may appeal the contracting officer\'92s findings or part thereof by furnishing the contracting officer a\
complete statement of the reasons for the disagreement with the findings.\
(d) The contracting officer shall promptly transmit the contracting officer\'92s findings and the contractor\'92s statement to the\
Administrator, Wage and Hour Division.\
(e) The Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, will respond directly to the contractor or subcontractor, with a copy\
to the contracting agency. The contractor or subcontractor may appeal the Administrator\'92s findings in accordance with\
the procedures outlined in Labor Department Regulations (29 CFR5.11). Hearings before administrative law judges are conducted in accordance with 29 CFR Part 6, and hearings before the Labor Department Administrative Review Board are conducted in accordance with 29 CFR Part 7.\
(f) The Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, may institute debarment proceedings against the contractor or subcontractor if the Administrator finds reasonable cause to believe that the contractor or subcontractor has committed willful or aggravated violations of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute or the Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act,\
or any of the applicable statutes listed in 29 CFR \cf3 5.1 \cf4 other than the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute, or has committed violations of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute that constitute a disregard of its obligations to employees or subcontractors under \cf3 40 U.S.C. 3144\cf4 .\

\f0\b 22.406-11 Contract terminations.\

\f1\b0 If a contract or subcontract is terminated for violation of the labor standards clauses, the contracting agency shall submit a report to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. The report shall include-\
(a) The number of the terminated contract;\
(b) The name and address of the terminated contractor or subcontractor;\
(c) The name and address of the contractor or subcontractor, if any, who is to complete the work; (d) The amount and number of the replacement contract, if any; and\
(e) A description of the work.\

\f0\b 22.406-12 Cooperation with the Department of Labor.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting agency shall cooperate with representatives of the Department of Labor in the inspection of records, interviews with workers, and all other aspects of investigations undertaken by the Department of Labor. When requested, the contracting agency shall furnish to the Secretary of Labor any available information on contractors, subcontractors, current and previous contracts, and the nature of the contract work.\
(b) If a Department of Labor representative undertakes an investigation at a construction project, the contracting officer shall inquire into the scope of the investigation, and request to be notified immediately of any violations discovered under the\

\fs24 Subpart 22.5 - Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects\

\fs20 22.501 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures to implement \cf3 Executive Order 14063\cf4 , Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects, dated February 4, 2022 (\cf3 3 CFR\cf4 , 2023 Comp., pp 335\'96338).\

\f0\b 22.502 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Construction 
\f1\i0 means construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, modernization, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, structures, highways, or other real property.\

\f2\i Labor organization 
\f1\i0 means a labor organization as defined in \cf3 29 U.S.C. 152(5) \cf4 of which building and construction employees are members.\

\f2\i Large-scale construction project 
\f1\i0 means a Federal construction project within the United States for which the total estimated cost of the construction contract to the Federal Government is $35 million or more.\

\f2\i Project labor agreement 
\f1\i0 means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in \cf3 29 U. S.C. 158(f)\cf4 .\

\f0\b 22.503 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 14063, Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects, requires agencies to use project labor agreements in large-scale construction projects to promote economy and efficiency in the administration and completion of Federal construction projects.\
(b) When awarding a contract in connection with a large-scale construction project (see \cf3 22.502\cf4 ), agencies shall require use of project labor agreements for contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the project, unless an exception at \cf3 22.504\cf4 (d) applies.\
(c) An agency may require the use of a project labor agreement on projects where the total cost to the Federal Government is less than that for a large-scale construction project, if appropriate.\
(1) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will\'97\
(i) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and\
(ii) Be consistent with law.\
(2) Agencies may consider the following factors in deciding whether the use of a project labor agreement is appropriate\
for a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is less than that for a large-scale construction project:\
(i) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.\
(ii) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.\
(iii) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.\
(iv) Project labor agreements have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or\
private entities in the geographic area of the project.\
(v) A project labor agreement will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training\
of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs. (vi) Any other factors that the agency decides are appropriate.\
(d) For indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts the use of a project labor agreement may be required on an order-by-order basis rather than for the entire contract. For an order at or above $35 million an agency shall require the use of a project labor agreement unless an exception applies. See \cf3 22.504\cf4 (d)(3) and \cf3 22.505\cf4 (b)(3).\

\f0\b 22.504 General requirements for project labor agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . Project labor agreements established under this subpart shall fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and Executive orders.\

\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (b) 
\f2\i Requirements
\f1\i0 . A project labor agreement shall-\
(1) Bind all contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply with the\
project labor agreement;\
(2) Allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they\
are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;\
(3) Contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;\
(4) Set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of\
the project labor agreement;\
(5) Provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including\
productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and\
(6) Include any additional requirements as the agency deems necessary to satisfy its needs.\
(c) 
\f2\i Labor organizations. 
\f1\i0 An agency may not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization.\
(d) 
\f2\i Exceptions to project labor agreement requirements\'97 
\f1\i0 (1) 
\f2\i Exception. 
\f1\i0 The senior procurement executive may grant an exception from the requirements at \cf3 22.503\cf4 (b), providing a specific written explanation of why at least one of the following conditions exists with respect to the particular contract:\
(i) Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would not advance the Federal Government's interests in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. The exception shall be based on one or more of the following factors:\
(A) The project is of short duration and lacks operational complexity.\
(B) The project will involve only one craft or trade.\
(C) The project will involve specialized construction work that is available from only a limited number of\
contractors or subcontractors.\
(D) The agency's need for the project is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that a project labor agreement\
would be impracticable.\
(ii) Market research indicates that requiring a project labor agreement on the project would substantially reduce the\
number of potential offerors to such a degree that adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price could not be achieved. (See \cf3 10.002\cf4 (b)(1) and \cf3 36.104\cf4 ). A likely reduction in the number of potential offerors is not, by itself, sufficient to except\
a contract from coverage under this authority unless it is coupled with the finding that the reduction would not allow for adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price.\
(iii) Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would otherwise be inconsistent with Federal statutes, regulations, Executive orders, or Presidential memoranda.\
(2) 
\f2\i Considerations. 
\f1\i0 When determining whether the exception in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section applies, contracting officers shall consider current market conditions and the extent to which price fluctuations may be attributable to factors other than the requirement for a project labor agreement ( 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 costs of labor or materials, supply chain costs). Agencies may rely on price analysis conducted on recent competitive proposals for construction projects of a similar size and scope.\
(3) 
\f2\i Timing of the exception 
\f1\i0 \'97\
(i) 
\f2\i Contracts other than IDIQ contracts. 
\f1\i0 The exception must be granted for a particular contract by the solicitation\
date.\
(ii) 
\f2\i IDIQ contracts. 
\f1\i0 An exception shall be granted prior to the solicitation date if the basis for the exception cited\
would apply to all orders. Otherwise, exceptions shall be granted for each order by the time of the notice of the intent to place an order ( 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 \cf3 16.505\cf4 (b)(1)).\

\f0\b 22.505 Solicitation provision and contract clause.\

\f1\b0 When a project labor agreement is used for a construction project, the contracting officer shall\'97\
(a) (1) Insert the provision at \cf3 52.222-33\cf4 , Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, in solicitations containing the clause 52.222\'9634, Project Labor Agreement.\
(2) Use the provision with its Alternate I if the agency will require the submission of a project labor agreement from only the apparent successful offeror, prior to contract award.\
(3) Use the provision with its Alternate II if an agency allows submission of a project labor agreement after contract award except when Alternate III is used.\
(4) Use the provision with its Alternate III when Alternate II of \cf3 52.222-34 \cf4 is used.\

\f1\b0 (i) Award of any contract, including any indefinite delivery contract or letter contract; or\
(ii) Modification of an existing contract for new effort that would constitute a contract award.\
(2) Preaward clearance for each proposed contract and for each proposed first-tier subcontract of $10 million or more shall be requested by the contracting officer directly from the OFCCP regional office(s). Verbal requests shall be confirmed\
by letter or facsimile transmission.\
(3) When the contract work is to be performed outside the United States with employees recruited within the United\
States, the contracting officer shall send the request for a preaward clearance to the OFCCP regional office serving the area where the proposed contractor\'92s corporate home or branch office is located in the United States, or the corporate location where personnel recruiting is handled, if different from the contractor\'92s corporate home or branch office. If the proposed contractor has no corporate office or location within the United States, the preaward clearance request action should be based on the location of the recruiting and training agency in the United States.\
(4) The contracting officer does not need to request a preaward clearance if-\
(i) The specific proposed contractor is listed in OFCCP\'92s National Preaward Registry via the Internet at \cf3 https://\
www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/pre-award/registry\cf4 ;\

evaluation by OFCCP. As soon as the apparently successful offeror can be determined, the contracting officer shall process a preaward clearance request in accordance with agency procedures, assuring, if possible, that the preaward clearance request is submitted to the OFCCP regional office at least 30 days before the proposed award date.\
(7) Within 15 days of the clearance request, OFCCP will inform the awarding agency of its intention to conduct\
a preaward compliance evaluation. If OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that period of its intention\
to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation, clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation, OFCCP shall be allowed an additional 20 days after the date that it so informs the awarding agency to provide its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide the awarding agency with its conclusions within that period, clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award.\

(1) 
\f2\i National security
\f1\i0 . The agency head may determine that a contract is essential to the national security and that the award of the contract without complying with one or more of the requirements of this subpart is necessary to the national security. Upon making such a determination, the agency shall notify the Deputy Assistant Secretary in writing within 30 days.\
(2) 
\f2\i Specific contracts
\f1\i0 . The Deputy Assistant Secretary may exempt an agency from requiring the inclusion of one or more of the requirements of E.O.11246 in any contract if the Deputy Assistant Secretary deems that special circumstances in the national interest so require. Groups or categories of contracts of the same type may also be exempted if the Deputy Assistant Secretary finds it impracticable to act upon each request individually or if group exemptions will contribute to convenience in the administration of E.O.11246.\
(b) The following exemptions apply even though a contract or subcontract contains the Equal Opportunity clause:\
(1) 
\f2\i Transactions of $10,000 or less
\f1\i0 . The Equal Opportunity clause is required to be included in prime contracts and\
subcontracts by \cf3 22.802\cf4 (a). Individual prime contracts or subcontracts of $10,000 or less are exempt from application of the Equal Opportunity clause, unless the aggregate value of all prime contracts or subcontracts awarded to a contractor in any 12- month period exceeds, or can reasonably be expected to exceed, $10,000. (Note: Government bills of lading, regardless of amount, are not exempt.)\
(2) 
\f2\i Work outside the United States. 
\f1\i0 Contracts are exempt from the requirements of E.O.11246 for work performed outside the United States by employees who were not recruited within the United States.\
(3) 
\f2\i Contracts with State or local governments
\f1\i0 . The requirements of E.O.11246 in any contract with a State or local government (or any agency, instrumentality, or subdivision thereof) shall not be applicable to any agency, instrumentality, or subdivision of such government that does not participate in work on or under the contract.\
(4) 
\f2\i Work on or near Indian reservations
\f1\i0 . It shall not be a violation of E.O.11246 for a contractor to extend a publicly announced preference in employment to Indians living on or near an Indian reservation in connection with employment opportunities on or near an Indian reservation. This applies to that area where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day. Contractors extending such a preference shall not, however, discriminate among Indians on the basis of religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or tribal affiliation, and the use of such preference shall not excuse a contractor from complying with E.O.11246, rules and regulations of the Secretary of Labor, and applicable clauses in the contract.\
(5) 
\f2\i Facilities not connected with contracts
\f1\i0 . The Deputy Assistant Secretary may exempt from the requirements of E.O.11246 any of a contractor\'92s facilities that the Deputy Assistant Secretary finds to be in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the contractor related to performing the contract, provided, that the Deputy Assistant Secretary also finds that the exemption will not interfere with, or impede the effectiveness of, E.O.11246.\
(6) 
\f2\i Indefinite-quantity contracts
\f1\i0 . With respect to indefinite-quantity contracts and subcontracts, the Equal Opportunity clause applies unless the contracting officer has reason to believe that the amount to be ordered in any year under the contract will not exceed $10,000. The applicability of the Equal Opportunity clause shall be determined by the contracting officer at the time of award for the firstyear, and annually thereafter for succeeding years, if any. Notwithstanding the above, the Equal Opportunity clause shall be applied to the contract whenever the amount of a single order exceeds $10,000. Once the Equal Opportunity clause is determined to be applicable, the contract shall continue to be subject to such clause for its duration regardless of the amounts ordered, or reasonably expected to be ordered, in anyyear.\
(7) 
\f2\i Contracts with religious entities
\f1\i0 . Pursuant to E.O. 13279, Section 202 of E.O. 11246, shall not apply to a Government contractor or subcontractor that is a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society, with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities. Such contractors and subcontractors are not exempted or excused from complying with the other requirements contained in the order.\

(2) To any sealed bid contract (including restricted sealed bidding), unless the withdrawal is made more than 10 days before the bid opening date.\

\f2\i etseq.
\f1\i0 ), and related Secretary of Labor regulations and instructions (29 CFR parts 4, 6, 8, and 1925).\

\f0\b 22.1001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Contractor 
\f1\i0 includes a subcontractor at any tier whose subcontract is subject to the provisions of the statute.\

\f2\i Multiple year contracts 
\f1\i0 means contracts having a term of more than 1 year regardless of fiscal year funding. The term\
includes multi year contracts (see \cf3 17.103\cf4 ).\

\f2\i United States 
\f1\i0 means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American\
Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and the outer Continental Shelf as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (\cf3 43 U.S.C.1331\cf4 , 
\f2\i etseq
\f1\i0 .), but does not include any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction or any U.S. base or possession within a foreign country (29 CFR 4.112).\

\f2\i Wage and Hour Division 
\f1\i0 means the unit in the Department of Labor to which is assigned functions of the Secretary of Labor under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute.\

\f2\i Wage determination 
\f1\i0 means a determination of minimum wages or fringe benefits made under \cf3 41 U.S.C.6703 \cf4 or 6707(c) applicable to the employment in a given locality of one or more classes of service employees.\

\f0\b 22.1002 Statutory and Executive order requirements.\
22.1002-1 General.\

\f1\b0 Service contracts over $2,500 shall contain mandatory provisions regarding minimum wages and fringe benefits, safe and sanitary working conditions, notification to employees of the minimum allowable compensation, and equivalent Federal employee classifications and wage rates. Under \cf3 41 U.S.C.6707(d)\cf4 , service contracts may not exceed 5 years.\

\f0\b 22.1002-2 Wage determinations based on prevailing rates.\

\f1\b0 Contractors performing on service contracts in excess of $2,500 to which no predecessor contractor\'92s collective bargaining agreement applies shall pay their employees at least the wages and fringe benefits found by the Department of Labor to prevail in the locality or, in the absence of a wage determination, the minimum wage set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act.\

\f0\b 22.1002-3 Wage determinations based on collective bargaining agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Successor contractors performing on contracts in excess of $2,500 for substantially the same services performed in the same locality must pay wages and fringe benefits (including accrued wages and benefits and prospective increases) at least equal to those contained in any bona fide collective bargaining agreement entered into under the predecessor contract. This requirement is self-executing and is not contingent upon incorporating a wage determination or the wage and fringe benefit terms of the predecessor contractor\'92s collective bargaining agreement in the successor contract. This requirement will not apply if the Secretary of Labor determines-\
(1) After a hearing, that the wages and fringe benefits are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a similar character in the locality; or\
(2) That the wages and fringe benefits are not the result of arm\'92s length negotiations.\
(b) Paragraphs in this \cf3 subpart 22.10 \cf4 which deal with this statutory requirement and the Department of Labor\'92s\
implementing regulations are \cf3 22.1010\cf4 , concerning notification to contractors and bargaining representatives of procurement dates; \cf3 22.1012-2\cf4 , explaining when a collective bargaining agreement will not apply due to late receipt by the contracting officer; and \cf3 22.1013 \cf4 and \cf3 22.1021\cf4 , explaining when the application of a collective bargaining agreement can be challenged due to a variance with prevailing rates or lack of arm\'92s length bargaining.\

\f0\b\fs20 22.1002-4 Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage.\

\f1\b0 No contractor or subcontractor holding a service contract for any dollar amount shall pay any of its employees working on the contract less than the minimum wage specified in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\cf3 29 U.S.C.206\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 22.1002-5 Executive Orders 13658 and 14026.\

\f1\b0 Executive Order (E.O.) 13658 established minimum wages for certain workers at $10.10 per hour. The E.O. 13658 rate has increased each year since 2015, rising to $11.25 on January 1, 2022. As of January 30, 2022, E.O. 13658 is superseded by E.O. 14026 to the extent that it is inconsistent with E.O. 14026; the minimum wage rate for certain workers is increased to $15.00 per hour. The wage rate is subject to annual increases by an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor. See \cf3 subpart\
22.19\cf4 . The clause at \cf3 52.222-55\cf4 , Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers under Executive Order 14026, requires the E.O. 14026 minimum wage rate to be paid if it is higher than other minimum wage rates, such as the \cf3 subpart 22.10 \cf4 statutory wage determination amount.\

\f0\b 22.1002-6 Executive Order 13706.\

\f1\b0 Executive Order 13706 establishes paid sick leave for employees of certain Federal contractors. See \cf3 subpart 22.21 \cf4 and the clause at \cf3 52.222-62\cf4 , Paid Sick Leave under Executive Order 13706.\

\f0\b 22.1003 Applicability.\
22.1003-1 General.\

\f1\b0 This \cf3 subpart 22.10 \cf4 applies to all Government contracts, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees, except as exempted in \cf3 22.1003-3 \cf4 and \cf3 22.1003-4 \cf4 of this section, or any subcontract at any tier thereunder. This subpart does not apply to individual contract requirements for services in contracts not having as their principal purpose the furnishing of services. The nomenclature, type, or particular form of contract used by contracting agencies is not determinative of coverage.\

\f0\b 22.1003-2 Geographical coverage of the Act.\

\f1\b0 The Service Contract Labor Standards statute applies to service contracts performed in the United States (see \cf3 22.1001\cf4 ). The Service Contract Labor Standards statute does not apply to contracts performed outside the United States.\

\f0\b 22.1003-3 Statutory exemptions.\

\f1\b0 The Service Contract Labor Standards statute does not apply to-\
(a) Any contract for construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings or public works, including painting and decorating;\
(b) Any work required to be done in accordance with the provisions of \cf3 41 U.S.C.chapter 65\cf4 ;\
(c) Any contract for transporting freight or personnel by vessel, aircraft, bus, truck, express, railroad, or oil or gas pipeline where published tariff rates are in effect;\
(d) Any contract for furnishing services by radio, telephone, or cable companies subject to the Communications Act of 1934;\
(e) Any contract for public utility services;\
(f) Any employment contract providing for direct services to a Federal agency by an individual or individuals; or (g) Any contract for operating postal contract stations for the U.S. Postal Service.\

\f0\b 22.1003-4 Administrative limitations, variations, tolerances, and exemptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Secretary of Labor may provide reasonable limitations and may make rules and regulations allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute other than \cf3 41 U.S.C.6707(f)\cf4 . These will be made only in special circumstances where it has been determined that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to protect prevailing labor standards (\cf3 41 U.S.C.6707(b)\cf4 ). See 29 CFR 4.123 for a listing of administrative exemptions, tolerances, and variations. Requests for limitations, variances, tolerances, and exemptions from the Service Contract Labor Standards statute shall be submitted in writing through contracting channels and the agency labor advisor to the Wage and Hour Administrator.\

\f0\b 22.1003-6 Repair distinguished from remanufacturing of equipment.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracts principally for remanufacturing of equipment which is so extensive as to be equivalent to manufacturing are subject to \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 65\cf4 , rather than to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute. Remanufacturing shall be deemed to be manufacturing when the criteria in either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section are met.\
(1) Major overhaul of an item, piece of equipment, or material which is degraded or inoperable, and under which all of the following conditions exist:\
(i) The item or equipment is required to be completely or substantially torn down into individual component parts. (ii) Substantially all of the parts are reworked, rehabilitated, altered and/or replaced.\
(iii) The parts are reassembled so as to furnish a totally rebuilt item or piece of equipment.\
(iv) Manufacturing processes similar to those which were used in the manufacturing of the item or piece of\
equipment are utilized.\
(v) The disassembled components, if usable (except for situations where the number of items or pieces of equipment\
involved are too few to make it practicable) are commingled with existing inventory and, as such, lose their identification with respect to a particular piece of equipment.\
(vi) The items or equipment overhauled are restored to original life expectancy, or nearly so.\
(vii) Such work is performed in a facility owned or operated by the contractor.\
(2) Major modification of an item, piece of equipment, or material which is wholly or partially obsolete, and under\
which all of the following conditions exist:\
(i) The item or equipment is required to be completely or substantially torn down.\
(ii) Outmoded parts are replaced.\
(iii) The item or equipment is rebuilt or reassembled.\
(iv) The contract work results in the furnishing of a substantially modified item in a usable and serviceable\
condition.\
(v) The work is performed in a facility owned or operated by the contractor.\
(b) Remanufacturing does not include the repair of damaged or broken equipment which does not require a complete teardown, overhaul, and rebuild as described in subparagraphs(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this subsection, or the periodic and routine maintenance, preservation, care, adjustment, upkeep, or servicing of equipment to keep it in usable, serviceable, working order. Such contracts typically are billed on an hourly rate (labor plus materials and parts) basis. Any contract principally for this type of work is subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute. Examples of such work include the following:\
(1) Repair of an automobile, truck, or other vehicle, construction equipment, tractor, crane, aerospace, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, electric motors, and ground powered industrial or vehicular equipment.\
(2) Repair of typewriters and other office equipment (but see \cf3 22.1003-4\cf4 (c)(1) and (d)(1)(iv)).\
(3) Repair of appliances, radios, television sets, calculators, and other electronic equipment.\

22.1006 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards, in solicitations and contracts (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) if the contract is subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and is-\
(i) Over $2,500; or\
(ii) For an indefinite dollar amount and the contracting officer does not know in advance that the contract amount will be $2,500 or less.\
(2) The contracting officer shall not insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-41 \cf4 (or any of the associated Service Contract Labor Standards statute clauses as prescribed in this section for possible use when \cf3 52.222-41 \cf4 applies) in the resultant contract if-\
(i) The solicitation includes the provision at-\
(A) \cf3 52.222-48\cf4 , Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to Contracts for\
Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Certification;\
(B) \cf3 52.222-52\cf4 , Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to Contracts for\
Certain Services-Certification; or\
(C) Either of the comparable certifications is checked as applicable in the provision at \cf3 52.204-8\cf4 (c)(2) or\
\cf3 52.212-3\cf4 (k); and\
(ii) The contracting officer has made the determination, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3) or (d)(3) of subsection\
\cf3 22.1003-4\cf4 , that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute does not apply to the contract. (In such case, insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-51\cf4 , Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, or \cf3 52.222-53\cf4 , Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in the contract, in accordance with the prescription at paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(4)(ii) of this subsection).\
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-42\cf4 , Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires, in solicitations and contracts if the contract amount is expected to be over $2,500 and the Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable. (See \cf3 22.1016\cf4 .)\
(c) (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-43\cf4 , Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract\
Labor Standards-Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts), or another clause which accomplishes the same purpose, in solicitations and contracts if the contract is expected to be a fixed-price, time-and-materials, or labor-hour service contract containing the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards, and is a multiple year contract or is a contract with options to renew which exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. The clause may be used in contracts that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The clause at \cf3 52.222-43\cf4 , Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Labor Standards-Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts), applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations and contracts subject to the incumbent contractor\'92s collective bargaining agreement in effect during this contract\'92s preceding contract period (see \cf3 22.1002-2 \cf4 and \cf3 22.1002-3\cf4 ). Contracting officers shall ensure that contract prices or contract unit price labor rates are adjusted only to the extent that a contractor\'92s increases or decreases in applicable wages and fringe benefits are made to comply with the requirements set forth in the clauses at \cf3 52.222-43 \cf4 (subparagraphs(d)(1), (2) and (3)), or \cf3 52.222-44 \cf4 (subparagraphs(b)(1) and (2)). (For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The contractor actually paid $4.10. The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50. The contractor increases the rate actually paid to $4.75 per hour. The allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour.)\

 22.1008 Procedures for obtaining wage determinations.\
22.1008-1 Obtaining wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers may obtain most prevailing wage determinations using the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website. Contracting officers may also use the Department of Labor\'92s e98 electronic process, located on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website, to request a wage determination directly from the Department of Labor. If the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 database does not contain the applicable prevailing wage determination for a contract action, the contracting officer must use the e98 process to request a wage determination from the Department of Labor.\
(b) In using the e98 process to obtain prevailing wage determinations, contracting officers shall provide as complete and accurate information on the e98 as possible. Contracting officers shall ensure that the email address submitted on an e98 request is accurate.\
(c) The contracting officer must anticipate the amount of time required to gather the information necessary to obtain a wage determination, including sufficient time, if necessary, to contact the Department of Labor to request wage determinations that are not available through use of the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 .\
(d) Although the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website provides assistance to the contracting agency to select\
the correct wage determination, the contracting agency remains responsible for the wage determination selected. If the contracting agency has used the e98 process, the Department of Labor will respond to the contracting agency based on the information provided on the e98. The contracting agency may rely upon the Department of Labor response as the correct wage determination for the contract.\
(e) To obtain the applicable wage determination for each contract action, the contracting officer shall determine the following information concerning the service employees expected to be employed by the contractor and any subcontractors in performing the contract:\
(1) Determine the classes of service employees to be utilized in performance of the contract using the Wage and Hour Division\'92s 
\f2\i Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations 
\f1\i0 (Directory). The Directory can be found on Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 Library Page, and is for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Publishing Office.\
(2) Determine the locality where the services will be performed (see \cf3 22.1009\cf4 ).\
(3) Determine whether \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 applies (see \cf3 22.1008-2\cf4 , \cf3 22.1010 \cf4 and \cf3 22.1002-2\cf4 ).\
(4) Determine the wage rate that would be paid each class if employed by the agency and subject to the wage\
provisions of \cf3 5 U.S.C. 5341 \cf4 and/or 5332 (see \cf3 22.1016\cf4 ).\
(f) If the contracting officer has questions regarding the procedures for obtaining a wage determination, or questions\
regarding the selection of a wage determination, the contracting officer should request assistance from the agency labor advisor.\

\f0\b 22.1008-2 Successorship with incumbent contractor collective bargaining agreement.\

\f1\b0 (a) Early in the acquisition cycle, the contracting officer shall determine whether \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 affects the new acquisition. The contracting officer shall determine whether there is a predecessor contract covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and, if so, whether the incumbent prime contractor or its subcontractors and any of their employees have a collective bargaining agreement.\
(b) \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 provides that a successor contractor must pay wages and fringe benefits (including accrued wages and benefits and prospective increases) to service employees at least equal to those agreed upon by a predecessor contractor under the following conditions:\
(1) The services to be furnished under the proposed contract will be substantially the same as services being furnished by an incumbent contractor whose contract the proposed contract will succeed.\
(2) The services will be performed in the same locality.\
(3) The incumbent prime contractor or subcontractor is furnishing such services through the use of service employees whose wages and fringe benefits are the subject of one or more collective bargaining agreements.\
(c) The application of \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 is subject to the following limitations:\
(1) \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 will not apply if the incumbent contractor enters into a collective bargaining agreement for the\
first time and the agreement does not become effective until after the expiration of the incumbent\'92s contract.\
(2) If the incumbent contractor enters into a new or revised collective bargaining agreement during the period of the\
incumbent\'92s performance on the current contract, the terms of the new or revised agreement shall not be effective for the purposes of \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 under the following conditions:\

\fs20 (i) (A) In sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify bidders (see \cf3 22.1012-2\cf4 (a)); or\
(B) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement after award, provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of award (see \cf3 22.1012-2\cf4 (b)); and\
(ii) The contracting officer has given both the incumbent contractor and its employees\'92 collective bargaining agent timely written notification of the applicable acquisition dates (see \cf3 22.1010\cf4 ).\
(d) (1) If \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 applies, the contracting officer shall obtain a copy of any collective bargaining agreement between an incumbent contractor or subcontractor and its employees. Obtaining a copy of an incumbent contractor\'92s collective bargaining agreement may involve coordination with the administrative contracting officer responsible for administering the predecessor contract. (Paragraph (m) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards, requires the incumbent prime contractor to furnish the contracting officer a copy of each collective bargaining agreement.)\
(2) If the contracting officer has timely received the collective bargaining agreement, the contracting officer may use the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website to prepare a wage determination referencing the agreement and incorporate\
that wage determination, attached to a complete copy of the collective bargaining agreement, into the successor contract action. In using the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 process, it is not necessary to submit a copy of the collective bargaining agreement to the Department of Labor unless requested to do so.\
(3) The contracting officer may also use the e98 process on Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 to request that the Department of Labor prepare the cover wage determination. The Department of Labor\'92s response to the e98 may include a request for the contracting officer to submit a complete copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Any questions regarding the applicability of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to a collective bargaining agreement should be directed to the agency labor advisor.\
(e) (1) \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 will not apply if the Secretary of Labor determines (i) after a hearing, that the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor\'92s collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a similar character in the locality, or (ii) that the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor\'92s collective bargaining agreement are not the result of arm\'92s length negotiations (see \cf3 22.1013 \cf4 and \cf3 22.1021\cf4 ). The Department of Labor (DOL) has concluded that contingent collective bargaining agreement provisions that attempt to limit a contractor\'92s obligations by means such as requiring issuance of a wage determination by the DOL, requiring inclusion of the wage determination in the contract, or requiring the Government to adequately reimburse the contractor, generally reflect a lack of arm\'92s length negotiations.\
(2) If the contracting officer\'92s review (see \cf3 22.1013\cf4 ) indicates that monetary provisions of the collective bargaining agreement may be substantially at variance or may not have been reached as a result of arm\'92s length bargaining, the contracting officer shall immediately contact the agency labor advisor to consider if further action is warranted.\
(f) If the services are being furnished at more than one location and the collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits are different at different locations or do not apply to one or more locations, the contracting officer shall identify the locations to which the agreements apply.\
(g) If the collective bargaining agreement does not apply to all service employees under the contract, the contracting officer shall access Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 to obtain the prevailing wage determination for those service employee classifications that are not covered by the collective bargaining agreement. The contracting officer shall separately list in the solicitation and contract the service employee classifications-\
(1) Subject to the collective bargaining agreement; and (2) Not subject to any collective bargaining agreement.\

\f0\b 22.1009 Place of performance unknown.\
22.1009-1 General.\

\f1\b0 If the place of performance is unknown, the contracting officer may use the procedures in this section. The contracting officer should first attempt to identify the specific places or geographical areas where the services might be performed (see \cf3 22.1009-2\cf4 ) and then may follow the procedures either in \cf3 22.1009-3 \cf4 or in \cf3 22.1009-4\cf4 .\

 22.1009-2 Attempt to identify possible places of performance.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer should attempt to identify the specific places or geographical areas where the services might be performed. The following may indicate possible places of performance:\
(a) Locations of previous contractors and their competitors.\
(b) Databases available via the Internet for lists of prospective offerors and contractors. (c) Responses to a presolicitation notice (see \cf3 5.204\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 22.1009-3 All possible places of performance identified.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the contracting officer can identify all the possible places or areas of performance (even though the actual place of performance will not be known until the successful offeror is chosen), the contracting officer shall obtain a wage determination for each locality where services may be performed (see \cf3 22.1008\cf4 ).\
(b) If the contracting officer subsequently learns of any potential offerors in previously unidentified places before the closing date for submission of offers, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Obtain wage determinations for the additional places of performance and amend the solicitation to include all wage determinations. If necessary, the contracting officer shall extend the time for submission of final offers; and\
(2) Follow the procedures in \cf3 22.1009-4\cf4 .\

\f0\b 22.1009-4 All possible places of performance not identified.\

\f1\b0 If the contracting officer believes that there may be offerors interested in performing in unidentified places or areas, the contracting officer may use the following procedures:\
(a) Include the following information in the synopsis and solicitation:\
(1) That the place of performance is unknown.\
(2) The possible places or areas of performance that the contracting officer has already identified.\
(3) That the contracting officer will obtain wage determinations for additional possible places of performance if asked\
to do so in writing.\
(4) The time and date by which offerors must notify the contracting officer of additional places of performance.\
(b) Include the information required by paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) of this section in the clause at \cf3 52.222-49\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards\'96Place of Performance Unknown (see \cf3 22.1006\cf4 (f)). The closing date for receipt of offerors\'92 requests for wage determinations for additional possible places of performance should allow reasonable time for potential offerors to review the solicitation and determine their interest in competing. Generally, 10 to 15 days from the date of issuance of the solicitation may be considered a reasonable period of time.\
(c) The procedures in \cf3 14.304 \cf4 shall apply to late receipt of offerors\'92 requests for wage determinations for additional places of performance. However, late receipt of an offeror\'92s request for a wage determination for additional places of performance does not preclude the offeror\'92s competing for the proposed acquisition.\
(d) If the contracting officer receives any timely requests for wage determinations for additional places of performance the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Obtain wage determinations for the additional places of performance; and\
(2) Amend the solicitation to include all wage determinations and, if necessary, extend the time for submission of final offers.\
(e) If the successful offeror did not make a timely request for a wage determination and will perform in a place of performance for which the contracting officer therefore did not request a wage determination, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Award the contract;\
(2) Obtain a wage determination; and\
(3) Incorporate the wage determination in the contract, retroactive to the date of contract award and with no adjustment\
in contract price, pursuant to the clause at \cf3 52.222-49\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards\'96Place of Performance Unknown.\

\f0\b 22.1010 Notification to interested parties under collective bargaining agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer should determine whether the incumbent prime contractor\'92s or its subcontractors\'92 service employees performing on the current contract are represented by a collective bargaining agent. If there is a collective bargaining agent, the contracting officer shall give both the incumbent contractor and its employees\'92 collective bargaining agent written notification of-\
(1) The forthcoming successor contract and the applicable acquisition dates (issuance of solicitation, opening of bids, commencement of negotiations, award of contract, or start of performance, as the case may be); or\

(b) This written notification must be given at least 30 days in advance of the earliest applicable acquisition date or the applicable annual or biennial anniversary date in order for the time-of-receipt limitations in paragraphs \cf3 22.1012-2\cf4 (a) and (b) to apply. The contracting officer shall retain a copy of the notification in the contract file.\

22.1012 Applicability of revisions to wage determinations.\
22.1012-1 Prevailing wage determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The Wage and Hour Administrator may issue revisions to prevailing wage determinations periodically. The need for inclusion of a revised prevailing wage determination in a solicitation, contract or contract modification (see \cf3 22.1007\cf4 )\
is determined by the date of receipt of the revised prevailing wage determination by the contracting agency. (Note the distinction between receipt by the agency and receipt by the contracting officer which may occur later.)\
(i) For purposes of using Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov
\f1\i0 , the time of receipt by the contracting agency shall be the first day of publication of the revised prevailing wage determination on the website.\
(ii) For purposes of using the e98 process, the time of receipt by the contracting agency shall be the date the agency receives actual notice of a new or revised prevailing wage determination from the Department of Labor as an e98 response.\
(2) In selecting a prevailing wage determination from the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website for use in a solicitation or other contract action, the contracting officer shall monitor the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised. Revisions published on the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within the timeframes prescribed at \cf3 22.1012-1\cf4 (b) and (c) are effective and must be included in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be accomplished by use of the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website\'92s "Alert Service".\
(b) The following shall apply when contracting by sealed bidding: a revised prevailing wage determination shall not be effective if it is received by the contracting agency less than 10 days before the opening of bids, and the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time to incorporate the revision in the solicitation.\
(c) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a revised prevailing wage determination received by the contracting agency after award of a new contract or a modification as specified in \cf3 22.1007\cf4 (b) shall not be effective provided that the\
start of performance is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, and if contract performance does not commence within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, any revision received by the contracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the work shall be effective.\
(d) If the contracting officer has submitted an e98 to the Department of Labor requesting a prevailing wage determination and has not received a response within 10 days, the contracting officer shall contact the Wage and Hour Division by telephone to determine when the wage determination can be expected. (The telephone number is provided on the e98 website.)\

\f0\b 22.1012-2 Wage determinations based on collective bargaining agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) In sealed bidding, a new or changed collective bargaining agreement shall not be effective under \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)\
\cf4 if the contracting agency has received notice of the terms of the new or changed collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and the contracting officer determines that there is not reasonable time to incorporate the new or changed terms of the collective bargaining agreement in the solicitation.\
(b) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a new or changed collective bargaining agreement shall not be effective under \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) \cf4 if notice of the terms of the new or changed collective bargaining agreement is received by the contracting agency after award of a successor contract or a modification as specified in \cf3 22.1007\cf4 (b), provided that the contract start of performance is within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification, or if contract performance does not commence within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification, any notice of the terms of a new or changed collective bargaining agreement received by the agency not less\

\f1\b0 than 10 days before commencement of the work shall be effective for purposes of the successor contract under \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)\cf4 .\
(c) The limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall apply only if timely notification required in \cf3 22.1010 \cf4 has been given.\
(d) If the contracting officer has submitted an e98 to Department of Labor requesting a wage determination based on\
a collective bargaining agreement and has not received a response from the Department of Labor within 10 days, the contracting officer shall contact the Wage and Hour Division by telephone to determine when the wage determination can be expected. (The telephone number is provided on the e98 website.) If the Department of Labor is unable to provide the wage determination by the latest date needed to maintain the acquisition schedule, the contracting officer shall incorporate the collective bargaining agreement itself in a solicitation or other contract action (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 exercise of option) and include a wage determination referencing that collective bargaining agreement created by use of the Wage Determinations at 
\f2\i SAM.gov 
\f1\i0 website (see \cf3 22.1008-1\cf4 (d)(2)).\

\f0\b 22.1013 Review of wage determination.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Based on incumbent collective bargaining agreement. 
\f1\i0 (1)If wages, fringe benefits, or periodic increases provided for in a collective bargaining agreement vary substantially from those prevailing for similar services in the locality, the contracting officer shall immediately contact the agency labor advisor to consider instituting the procedures in \cf3 22.1021\cf4 .\
(1) If the contracting officer believes that an incumbent or predecessor contractor\'92s agreement was not the result of arm\'92s length negotiations, the contracting officer shall contact the agency labor advisor to determine appropriate action.\
(b) 
\f2\i Based on other than incumbent collective bargaining agreement. 
\f1\i0 Upon receiving a wage determination not predicated upon a collective bargaining agreement, the contracting officer shall ascertain-\
(1) If the wage determination does not conform with wages and fringe benefits prevailing for similar services in the locality; or\
(2) If the wage determination contains significant errors or omissions. If either subparagraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is evident, the contracting officer shall contact the agency labor advisor to determine appropriate action.\

\f0\b 22.1014 Delay over 60 days in bid opening or commencement of work.\

\f1\b0 If a wage determination was obtained through the e98 process, and bid opening, or commencement of work under a negotiated contract has been delayed, for whatever reason, more than 60 days from the date indicated on the previously submitted e98, the contracting officer shall submit a new e98. Any revision of a wage determination received by the contracting agency as a result of that communication shall supersede the earlier response as the wage determination applicable to the particular acquisition subject to the time frames in \cf3 22.1012-1\cf4 (b) and (c).\

\f0\b 22.1015 Discovery of errors by the Department of Labor.\

\f1\b0 If the Department of Labor discovers and determines, whether before or after a contract award, that a contracting officer made an erroneous determination that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute did not apply to a particular acquisition or failed to include an appropriate wage determination in a covered contract, the contracting officer, within 30 days of notification by the Department of Labor, shall include in the contract the clause at \cf3 52.222-41 \cf4 and any applicable wage determination issued by the Administrator. If the contract is subject to \cf3 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)\cf4 , the Administrator may require retroactive application of that wage determination. The contracting officer shall equitably adjust the contract price to reflect any changed cost of performance resulting from incorporating a wage determination or revision.\

\f0\b 22.1016 Statement of equivalent rates for Federal hires.\

\f1\b0 (a) The statement required under the clause at \cf3 52.222-42\cf4 , Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires, (see \cf3 22.1006\cf4 (b)) shall set forth those wage rates and fringe benefits that would be paid by the contracting activity to the various classes of service employees expected to be utilized under the contract if \cf3 5 U.S.C.5332 \cf4 (General Schedule-white collar) and/ or \cf3 5 U.S.C.5341 \cf4 (Wage Board-blue collar) were applicable.\
(b) Procedures for computation of these rates are as follows:\
(1) Wages paid blue collar employees shall be the basic hourly rate for each class. The rate shall be Wage Board pay\
schedule step two for nonsupervisory service employees and step three for supervisory service employees.\
(2) Wages paid white collar employees shall be an hourly rate for each class. The rate shall be obtained by dividing the\
general pay schedule step one biweekly rate by 80.\
(3) Local civilian personnel offices can assist in determining and providing grade and salary data.\

22.1018 Notification to contractors and employees.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall take the following steps to ensure that service employees are notified of minimum wages and fringe benefits.\
(a) As soon as possible after contract award, inform the contractor of the labor standards requirements of the contract relating to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and of the contractor\'92s responsibilities under these requirements, unless it is clear that the contractor is fully informed.\
(b) At the time of award, furnish the contractor Department of Labor Publication WH-1313, Notice to Employees Working on Government Contracts, for posting at a prominent and accessible place at the worksite before contract performance begins. The publication advises employees of the compensation (wages and fringe benefits) required to be paid or furnished under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and satisfies the notice requirements in paragraph (g) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards.\
(c) Attach any applicable wage determination to Publication WH-1313.\

\f0\b 22.1019 Additional classes of service employees.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the contracting officer is aware that contract performance involves classes of service employees not included in\
the wage determination, the contracting officer shall require the contractor to classify the unlisted classes so as to provide a reasonable relationship (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 appropriate level of skill comparison) between the unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the determination (see paragraph (c) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards). The contractor shall initiate the conforming procedure before unlisted classes of employees perform contract work. The contractor shall submit \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 1444\cf4 , Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate. The contracting\
officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed \cf3 SF 1444 \cf4 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees\'92 representative or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation) and all other pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division. Within 30 days of receipt of the request, the Wage and Hour Division will (1) approve, modify, or disapprove the request when the parties are in agreement or (2) render a final determination in the event of disagreement among the parties. If the Wage and Hour Division will require more than 30 days to take action, it will notify the contracting officer within 30 days of receipt of the request that additional time is necessary.\
(b) Some wage determinations will list a series of classes within a job classification family, for example, Computer Operators, level I, II, and III, or Electronic Technicians, level I, II, and III, or Clerk Typist, level I and II. Generally, level I\
is the lowest level. It is the entry level, and establishment of a lower level through conformance is not permissible. Further, trainee classifications may not be conformed. Helpers in skilled maintenance trades (for example, electricians, machinists, and automobile mechanics) whose duties constitute, in fact, separate and distinct jobs may also be used if listed on the wage determination, but may not be conformed. Conformance may not be used to artificially split or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. However, conforming procedures may be used if the work which an employee performs under the contract is not within the scope of any classification listed on the wage determination, regardless of job title. (See 29 CFR 4.152.)\
(c) Subminimum rates for apprentices, student learners, and disabled workers are permissible in accordance with paragraph (q) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards.\

\f0\b 22.1020 Seniority lists.\

\f1\b0 If a contract is performed at a Federal facility where employees may be hired/retained by a succeeding contractor,\
the incumbent prime contractor is required to furnish a certified list of all service employees on the contractor\'92s or subcontractor\'92s payroll during the last month of the contract, together with anniversary dates of employment, to the contracting officer no later than 10 days before contract completion. (See paragraph (n) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards.) At the commencement of the succeeding contract, the contracting officer shall provide a copy\
of the list to the successor contractor for determining employee eligibility for vacation or other fringe benefits which are based upon length of service, including service with predecessor contractors if such benefit is required by an applicable wage determination.\

 22.1021 Request for hearing.\

\f1\b0 (a) A contracting agency or other interested party may request a hearing on an issue presented in \cf3 22.1013\cf4 (a). To obtain a hearing for the contracting agency, the contracting officer shall submit a written request through appropriate channels (ordinarily the agency labor advisor) to\'97\
Administrator, Wage and Hour Division\

(2) The name of the contracting agency whose contract is involved;\
(3) A brief description of the services to be performed under the contract;\
(4) The status of the procurement and any estimated procurement dates, such as bid opening, contract award, and commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option period;\
(5) A statement of the applicant\'92s case, setting forth in detail the reasons why the applicant believes that a substantial variance exists with respect to some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits;\
(6) Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties; and\
(7) Any other data required by the Administrator. (c) A request for an arm\'92s length hearing shall include-\
(1) A statement of the applicant\'92s case, setting forth in detail the reasons why the applicant believes that the wages and fringe benefits contained in the collective bargaining agreement were not reached as a result of arm\'92s length negotiations;\
(2) A statement regarding the status of the procurement and any estimated procurement dates, such as bid opening, contract award, and commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option period; and\
(3) Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties.\
(d) Unless the Administrator determines that extraordinary circumstances exist, the Administrator will not consider\
requests for a hearing unless received as follows:\
(1) For sealed bid contracts, more than 10 days before the award of the contract; or\
(2) For negotiated contracts and for contracts with provisions exceeding the initial term by option, before the\
commencement date of the contract or the follow-up option period.\

\f0\b 22.1022 Withholding of contract payments.\

\f1\b0 Any violations of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards, as amended, renders the responsible contractor liable for the amount of any deductions, rebates, refunds, or underpayments (which includes nonpayment) of compensation due employees performing the contract. The contracting officer may withhold-or, upon written request of\
the Department of Labor from a level no lower than that of Deputy Regional Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, shall withhold-the amount needed to pay such underpaid employees from accrued payments due the contractor on the contract, or on any other prime contract (whether subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or not) with the contractor. The agency shall place the amount withheld in a deposit fund. Such withheld funds shall be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement to the underpaid employees on order of the Secretary (or authorized representatives), and Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board. In addition, the Department of\
Labor has given blanket approval to forward withheld funds pending completion of an investigation or other administrative proceeding when disposition of withheld funds remains the final action necessary to close out a contract.\

\f0\b 22.1023 Termination for default.\

\f1\b0 As provided by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, any contractor failure to comply with the requirements of the contract clauses related to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute may be grounds for termination for default (see paragraph (k) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards).\

\f0\b 22.1024 Cooperation with the Department of Labor.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer shall cooperate with Department of Labor representatives in the examination of records, interviews with service employees, and all other aspects of investigations undertaken by the Department. When asked, agencies shall furnish the Wage and Hour Administrator or a designee, any available information on contractors, subcontractors, their contracts, and the nature of the contract services. The contracting officer shall promptly refer, in writing to the appropriate\

\f1\b0 Persons or firms found to be in violation of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute will have an active exclusion record contained in the System for Award Management (see \cf3 9.404\cf4 ).

This prohibition against award to an ineligible contractor applies to both prime and subcontracts.\

\f0\b 22.1026 Disputes concerning labor standards.\

\f1\b0 Disputes concerning labor standards requirements of the contract are handled under paragraph (t) of the contract clause at \cf3 52.222-41\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards, and not under the clause at \cf3 52.233-1\cf4 , Disputes.\

\fs24 Subpart 22.11 - Professional Employee Compensation\

\fs20 22.1101 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 The Service Contract Act of 1965, now codified at \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 67\cf4 , Service Contract Labor Standards, was enacted to ensure that Government contractors compensate their blue-collar service workers and some white-collar service workers fairly, but it does not cover bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employees.\

\f0\b 22.1102 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Professional employee
\f1\i0 , as used in this subpart, means any person meeting the definition of "employee employed in a bona fide . . . professional capacity" given in 29 CFR541. The term embraces members of those professions having a recognized status based upon acquiring professional knowledge through prolonged study. Examples of these professions include accountancy, actuarial computation, architecture, dentistry, engineering, law, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, the sciences (such as biology, chemistry, and physics, and teaching). To be a professional employee, a person must not only be a professional but must be involved essentially in discharging professional duties.\

\f0\b 22.1103 Policy, procedures, and solicitation provision.\

\f1\b0 All professional employees shall be compensated fairly and properly. Accordingly, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at \cf3 52.222-46\cf4 , Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees, in solicitations for negotiated contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed $750,000 and services are to be provided which will require meaningful numbers of professional employees. This provision requires that offerors submit for evaluation a total compensation\
plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating unrealistically low professional employee compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award.\

\f1\b0 Agencies must take appropriate action to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor, consistent with \cf3 19 U.S.C.1307\cf4 ,\cf3 29 U.S.C.201\cf4 ,

\f1\b0 (a) When issuing a solicitation for supplies expected to exceed the micro-purchase threshold, the contracting officer\
must check the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor (the List) ( \cf3 www.dol.gov/ilab/\cf4 ) (see \cf3 22.1505\cf4 (a)). Appearance of a product on the List is not a bar to purchase of any such product mined, produced, or manufactured in the identified country, but rather is an alert that there is a reasonable basis to believe that such product may have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor.\
(b) The requirements of this subpart that result from the appearance of any end product on the List do not apply to a solicitation or contract if the identified country of origin on the List is-\
(1) Israel, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $50,000 or more (see \cf3 25.406\cf4 );\

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, before the contracting officer may make an award for an end product (regardless of country of origin) of a type identified by country of origin on the List the offeror must certify that-\
(1) It will not supply any end product on the List that was mined, produced, or manufactured in a country identified on the List for that product, as specified in the solicitation by the contracting officer in the Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products; or\
(2) (i) It has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any end product to be furnished under the contract that is on the List and was mined, produced, or manufactured in a country identified on the List for that product; and\
(ii) On the basis of those efforts, the offeror is unaware of any such use of child labor.\
(d) Absent any actual knowledge that the certification is false, the contracting officer must rely on the offerors\'92\
certifications in making award decisions.\

(f) Proper certification will not prevent the head of an agency from imposing remedies in accordance with section\
\cf3 22.1504\cf4 (a)(4) if it is later discovered that the contractor has furnished an end product or component that has in fact been mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, using forced or indentured child labor.\

\f0\b 22.1504 Violations and remedies.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Violations. 
\f1\i0 The Government may impose remedies set forth in paragraph (b) of this section for the following violations (note that the violations in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section go beyond violations of the requirements relating to certification of end products) (see \cf3 22.1503\cf4 ):\

\fs24 Subpart 22.18 - Employment Eligibility Verification\

\fs20 22.1800 Scope.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies and procedures requiring contractors to utilize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Service\'92s employment eligibility verification program (E-Verify) as the means for verifying employment eligibility of certain employees.\

\f0\b 22.1801 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item
\f1\i0 -\

(i) A commercial product (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of \'93commercial product\'94 at \cf3 2.101\cf4 ); (ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and\
(iii) Offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial\
marketplace; and\
(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in \cf3 46 U.S.C. 40102(4)\cf4 , such as agricultural products and petroleum\
products. Per 46 CFR 525.1 (c)(2), "bulk cargo" means cargo that is loaded and carried in bulk onboard ship without mark or count, in a loose unpackaged form, having homogenous characteristics. Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.\

\f2\i Employee assigned to the contract 
\f1\i0 means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), who is directly performing work, in the United States, under a contract that is required to include the clause prescribed at \cf3 22.1803\cf4 . An employee is not considered to be directly performing work under a contract if the employee-\
(1) Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead functions; and\
(2) Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.\

\f2\i Subcontract 
\f1\i0 means any contract, as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf4 , entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services\
for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract. It includes but is not limited to purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders.\

\f2\i Subcontractor 
\f1\i0 means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies or services to or for a prime contractor or another subcontractor.\

\f2\i United States
\f1\i0 , as defined in \cf3 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38)\cf4 , means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\

\f0\b 22.1802 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Statutes and Executive orders require employers to abide by the immigration laws of the United States and to employ in the United States only individuals who are eligible to work in the United States. The E-Verify program provides an Internet-based means of verifying employment eligibility of workers employed in the United States, but is not a substitute for any other employment eligibility verification requirements.\
(b) Contracting officers shall include in solicitations and contracts, as prescribed at \cf3 22.1803\cf4 , requirements that Federal contractors must-\
(1) Enroll as Federal contractors in E-Verify;\
(2) Use E-Verify to verify employment eligibility of all new hires working in the United States, except that the contractor may choose to verify only new hires assigned to the contract if the contractor is-\
(i) An institution of higher education (as defined at \cf3 20 U.S.C. 1001(a)\cf4 );\
(ii) A State or local government or the government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or\
(iii) A surety performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency pursuant to a performance\
bond;\
(3) Use E-Verify to verify employment eligibility of all employees assigned to the contract; and (4) Include these requirements, as required by the clause at \cf3 52.222-54\cf4 , in subcontracts for-\
(i) Services, except for commercial services that are part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an item that would be a COTS item, but for minor modifications), performed by the COTS provider, and are normally provided for that COTS item; and\
(ii) Construction.\

\fs20 (c) Contractors may elect to verify employment eligibility of all existing employees working in the United States who were hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) instead of just those employees assigned to the contract. The contractor is not required to verify employment eligibility of-\
(1) Employees who hold an active security clearance of confidential, secret, or top secret; or\
(2) Employees for whom background investigations have been completed and credentials issued pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12.\
(d) In exceptional cases, the head of the contracting activity may waive the E-Verify requirement for a contract or subcontract or a class of contracts or subcontracts, either temporarily or for the period of performance. This waiver authority may not be delegated.\
(e) DHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate a contractor\'92s MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU. If DHS or SSA terminates a contractor\'92s MOU, the terminating agency must refer the contractor to a suspension or debarment official for possible suspension or debarment action. During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend or debar, the contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b) of the clause at \cf3 52.222-54\cf4 . If the contractor is suspended or debarred as a result of the MOU termination, the contractor is not eligible to participate in E-Verify during the period of its suspension or debarment. If the suspension or debarment official determines not to suspend or debar the contractor, then the contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.\

\f0\b 22.1803 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 Insert the clause at \cf3 52.222-54\cf4 , Employment Eligibility Verification, in all solicitations and contracts that exceed $150,000, except those that\'97\
(a) Are only for work that will be performed outside the United States; (b) Are for a period of performance of less than 120 days; or\
(c) Are only for-\
(1) Commercially available off-the-shelf items;\
(2) Items that would be COTS items, but for minor modifications (as defined at paragraph (3)(ii) of the definition of "commercial products" at \cf3 2.101\cf4 );\
(3) Items that would be COTS items if they were not bulk cargo; or (4) Commercial services that are-\
(i) Part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an item that would be a COTS item, but for minor modifications); (ii) Performed by the COTS provider; and\
(iii) Are normally provided for that COTS item.\

This E.O. superseded E.O. 13658; DOL implementing regulations for E.O. 13658 are found at 29 CFR part 10.\

\f0\b 22.1901 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart\'97\

\f2\i United States 
\f1\i0 means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and the outer Continental Shelf as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331, 
\f2\i et seq.
\f1\i0 ).\

\f2\i Worker
\f1\i0 , (in accordance with 29 CFR 23.20)\'96\
(1) (i) Means any person engaged in performing work on, or in connection with, a contract covered by Executive Order\
14026, and\
(A) Whose wages under such contract are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. chapter 8), the\
Service Contract Labor Standards statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 67), or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV),\
(B) Other than individuals employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541,\
(C) Regardless of the contractual relationship alleged to exist between the individual and the employer.\
(ii) Includes workers performing on, or in connection with, the contract whose wages are calculated pursuant to\
special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c).\
(iii) Also includes any person working on, or in connection with, the contract and individually registered in a bona\
fide apprenticeship or training program registered with the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship.\
(2) (i) A worker performs on a contract if the worker directly performs the specific services called for by the contract; and\
(ii) A worker performs 
\f2\i in connection with 
\f1\i0 a contract if the worker's work activities are necessary to the performance of a contract but are not the specific services called for by the contract.\

\f0\b 22.1902 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Pursuant to Executive Order 14026, the minimum hourly wage rate required to be paid to workers performing on, or in connection with, contracts and subcontracts subject to this subpart is\'97\
(1) At least $15.00 per hour beginning January 30, 2022; and\
(2) Beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division (the Administrator) will notify the public of the new E.O. minimum wage rate at least 90 days before it is to take effect. (See \cf3 22.1904\cf4 .)\
(b) Relationship with other wage rates. (1) Nothing in this subpart shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law or any applicable law or municipal ordinance or any applicable contract establishing a minimum wage higher than the E.O. minimum wage. However, wage increases under such other laws or municipal ordinances are not subject to price adjustment under this subpart.\
(2) The E.O. minimum wage rate applies whenever it is higher than any applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) wage rate.\
(c) Application to tipped workers. Policies and procedures in DOL regulations at 29 CFR 23.240(b) and 23.280 address the relationship between the E.O. minimum wage and wages of workers engaged in an occupation in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips.\

Prices will be adjusted only for increased labor costs (including subcontractor labor costs) as a result of the annual E.O. minimum wage, and for associated labor costs (including those\
for subcontractors). Associated labor costs shall include increases or decreases that result from changes in social security and unemployment taxes and workers\'92 compensation insurance, but will not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.\
(2) The wage rate price adjustment under this clause is the lowest amount calculated by subtracting from the new E.O. wage rate the following: the current E.O. minimum wage rate; the current service or construction wage determination rate under the contract (if the wage rate is applicable to that worker); or the actual wage currently paid the worker. If the amount is zero or below, there will be no increase paid for this worker.\
\cf2 (i) Example 1 - New E.O. wage rate is $16.10.\

(iv) Information concerning known settlement negotiations between the parties, if applicable; and\
(v) Any other relevant facts known to the contracting officer or other information requested by the Wage and Hour\
Division.\
(c) Investigations. Complaints will be investigated by the Administrator, if warranted, in accordance with the procedures\
in 29 CFR part 23.430.\
(d) Remedies and sanctions\'96 (1) Unpaid wages. When the Administrator\'92s investigation reveals that a contractor has failed\
to pay the applicable E.O. minimum wage, the Administrator will notify the contractor and the contracting agency of the unpaid wage violation, and request that the contractor remedy the violation. If the contractor does not remedy the violation, the Administrator may direct withholding of payments due on the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Federal Government. Upon final decision and direction of the Administrator, the contracting agency shall transfer the withheld funds to the Department of Labor for disbursement in accordance with the procedures at \cf3 22.406-9\cf4 (c).\

\f2\i Antiretaliation
\f1\i0 . When a contractor has been found to have violated paragraph (i) of clause \cf3 52.222-55\cf4 , Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers Under Executive Order 14026, the Administrator may provide for relief to the worker in accordance with 29 CFR 23.440.\

an authorized representative of the Department of Labor, shall incorporate the contract clause in the contract retroactive to commencement of performance under the contract through the exercise of any and all authority that may be needed (including, where necessary, its authority to negotiate or amend, its authority to pay any necessary additional costs, and its authority under any contract provision authorizing changes, cancellation and termination).\

\f2\i Accrual year 
\f1\i0 means the 12-month period during which a contractor may limit an employee's accrual of paid sick leave to no less than 56 hours (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(1)).\

\f2\i Certification issued by a health care provider 
\f1\i0 has the meaning given in 29 CFR \cf3 13.2\cf4 . 
\f2\i Employee
\f1\i0 -\
(1) (i) Means any person engaged in performing work on or in connection with a contract covered by E.O. 13706; and (A) Whose wages under such contract are governed by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (\cf3 41 U.S.C.\
chapter 67\cf4 ), the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (\cf3 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV\cf4 ), or the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. chapter 8);\
(B) Including employees who qualify for an exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime provisions; and\
(C) Regardless of the contractual relationship alleged to exist between the individual and the employer; and\
(ii) Includes any person performing work on or in connection with the contract and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship or training program registered with the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration,\
Office of Apprenticeship, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship.\
(2) (i) An employee performs 
\f2\i on 
\f1\i0 a contract if the employee directly performs the specific services called for by the\
contract; and\
(ii) An employee performs 
\f2\i in connection with 
\f1\i0 a contract if the employee's work activities are necessary to the\
performance of a contract but are not the specific services called for by the contract.\

\f2\i Health care provider

\f2\i Multiemployer plan 
\f1\i0 means a plan to which more than one employer is required to contribute and which is maintained\

\f0\b 22.2102 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Government shall require contractors to allow employees performing work on or in connection with a contract covered by E.O. 13706 to accrue and use paid sick leave in accordance with the E.O. and 29 CFR Part 13.\
(b) Interaction with other laws. Nothing in E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR Part 13 shall excuse noncompliance with or supersede any applicable Federal or State law, any applicable law or municipal ordinance, or a collective bargaining agreement requiring greater paid sick leave or leave rights than those established under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR Part 13. For additional details regarding interaction with the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and State and local paid sick time laws, see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (f)(2) through (4).\

\fs20 (2) Require performance in whole or in part within the United States. When performance is in part within and in part outside the United States, this subpart applies to the part of the contract that is performed within the United States; and\
(b) Employees performing on or in connection with such contracts whose wages are governed by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, or the Fair Labor Standards Act, including employees who qualify for an exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime provisions.\

\f0\b 22.2104 Exclusions.\

\f1\b0 The following are excluded from coverage under this subpart:\
(a) Employees performing in connection with contracts covered by the E.O. for less than 20 percent of their work hours\
in a given workweek. This exclusion is inapplicable to employees performing on contracts covered by the E.O., i.e., those employees directly engaged in performing the specific work called for by the contract, at any point during the workweek (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.4\cf4 (e)).\
(b) Until the earlier of the date the agreement terminates or January 1, 2020, employees whose covered work is governed by a collective bargaining agreement ratified before September 30, 2016, that-\
(1) Already provides 56 hours (or 7 days, if the agreement refers to days rather than hours) of paid sick time (or paid time off that may be used for reasons related to sickness or health care) each year; or\
(2) Provides less than 56 hours (or 7 days, if the agreement refers to days rather than hours) of paid sick time (or paid time off that may be used for reasons related to sickness or health care) each year, provided that each year the contractor provides covered employees with the difference between 56 hours (or 7 days) and the amount provided under the existing agreement in accordance with 29 CFR \cf3 13.4\cf4 (f).\
(c) The Government's unilateral exercise of a pre-negotiated option to renew an existing contract that does not contain the clause at \cf3 52.222-62 \cf4 will not automatically trigger the application of that clause. (See definition of "new contract" at 29 CFR \cf3 13.2\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 22.2105 Paid sick leave for Federal contractors and subcontractors.\

\f1\b0 In accordance with 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 , and by operation of the clause at \cf3 52.222-62\cf4 , Paid Sick Leave Under Executive Order 13706, the following contractor requirements apply:\
(a) Accrual. (1) Contractors are required to permit an employee to accrue not less than 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked on or in connection with a contract covered by the E.O. (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (a)(1)).\
(2) Contractors are required to inform each employee, in writing, of the amount of paid sick leave the employee has accrued but not used no less than once each pay period or each month, whichever interval is shorter, as well as upon a separation from employment and upon reinstatement of paid sick leave, pursuant to 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(4) (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (a) (2)).\
(3) Contractors may choose to provide employees with at least 56 hours of paid sick leave at the beginning of each accrual year rather than allowing the employee to accrue such leave based on hours worked over time (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (a) (3)).\
(b) Maximum accrual, carryover, reinstatement, and payment for unused leave. (1) Contractors may limit the amount of paid sick leave employees are permitted to accrue to not less than 56 hours in each accrual year (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(1)).\
(2) Paid sick leave shall carry over from one accrual year to the next. Paid sick leave carried over from the previous accrual year shall not count toward any limit the contractor sets on annual accrual (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(2)).\
(3) Contractors may limit the amount of paid sick leave an employee is permitted to have available for use at any point to not less than 56 hours (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(3)).\
(4) Contractors are required to reinstate paid sick leave for employees only when rehired by the same contractor within 12 months after a job separation (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(4)).\
(5) Nothing in E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR Part 13 requires contractors to make a financial payment to an employee for accrued paid sick leave that has not been used upon a separation from employment. If a contractor nevertheless makes such a payment in an amount equal to or greater than the value of the pay and benefits the employee would have received pursuant to 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (c)(3) had the employee used the paid sick leave, the contractor is relieved of the obligation to reinstate an employee's accrued paid sick leave upon rehiring the employee within 12 months of the separation pursuant to 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(4) (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (b)(5)).\
(c) 
\f2\i Use
\f1\i0 . Contractors are required to permit an employee to use paid sick leave in accordance with 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (c).\
(d) 
\f2\i Request for paid sick leave
\f1\i0 . Contractors are required to permit an employee to use any or all of the employee's available paid sick leave upon the oral or written request of an employee that includes information sufficient to inform the\
  22.19-2\

\f0\b \cf2 22.2109\
 
\f1\b0 contractor that the employee is seeking to be absent from work for a purpose described in 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (c) and, to the extent reasonably feasible, the anticipated duration of the leave (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (d)).\
(e) 
\f2\i Certification or documentation for leave of 3 or more consecutive full workdays
\f1\i0 . Contractors may require certification issued by a health care provider to verify the need for paid sick leave used for a purpose described in 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), or documentation from an appropriate individual or organization to verify the need for paid sick leave used for a purpose described in 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (c)(1)(iv), only if the employee is absent for 3 or more consecutive full workdays (see 29 CFR \cf3 13.5\cf4 (e)).\

\f0\b 22.2106 Prohibited acts.\

\f1\b0 In accordance with 29 CFR 13.6, and by operation of the clause at \cf3 52.222-62\cf4 , Paid Sick Leave Under Executive Order 13706, a contractor may not-\
(a) Interfere with an employee's accrual or use of paid sick leave as required by E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR Part 13 (see 29 CFR 13.6(a));\

(1) Using, or attempting to use, paid sick leave as provided for under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR Part 13;\

(c) Fail to make and maintain or to make available to authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division records for inspection, copying, and transcription as required by 29 CFR 13.25, or otherwise fail to comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 13.25 (see 29 CFR 13.6(c)).\

\f0\b 22.2107 Waiver of rights.\

\f1\b0 Employees cannot waive, nor may contractors induce employees to waive, their rights under E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR Part 13 (see 29 CFR 13.7).\

\f0\b 22.2108 Multiemployer plans or other funds, plans, or programs.\

\f1\b0 Contractors may fulfill their obligations under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR Part 13 jointly with other contractors through a multi-employer plan, or may fulfill their obligations through an individual fund, plan, or program (see 29 CFR 13.8).\

Contracting agencies do not have authority to conduct compliance investigations under 29 CFR Part 13 as implemented in this subpart. This does not limit the contracting officer's authority to otherwise enforce the terms and conditions of the contract.\
(b)

(3) If the contracting agency receives a complaint or is notified that the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division has received a complaint, the contracting officer shall report, within 14 days, to the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Office of Government Contracts, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Room S3006, Washington, D.C. 20210, all of the following information that is available without conducting an investigation:\

(B) Other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation; or (C) Appropriate equitable or other relief.\
(iii) Payment of liquidated damages in an amount equaling any monetary relief may also be directed unless such amount is reduced by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division because the violation was in good faith and the contractor had reasonable grounds for believing it had not violated the E.O. or 29 CFR Part 13.\

\f0\b 23.103 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall procure sustainable products and services (as defined in \cf3 2.101\cf2 ) to the maximum extent practicable.\
(1) Procuring sustainable products and services is considered practicable, unless the agency cannot acquire products or\
services\'97\
(i) Competitively within a reasonable performance schedule; (ii) That meet reasonable performance requirements; or\
(iii) At a reasonable price (see \cf3 23.103\cf2 (a)(2)).\
(2) When considering whether the price of a sustainable product is reasonable, agencies should consider whether\
the product is cost-effective over the life of the product. For ENERGY STAR\'ae or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP)-designated products, a price is reasonable if it is cost-effective over the life of the product taking energy cost savings into account (\cf3 42 U.S.C. 8259b(b)(2)\cf2 ). Life-cycle cost savings tools for energy-efficient products are available at \cf3 https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/save_energy_commercial_buildings/ways_save/energy_efficient_products \cf2 and \cf3 https:// www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech-lcoe.html\cf2 .\
(b) When procuring sustainable products and services, agencies shall\'97\
(1) Ensure compliance with applicable statutory purchasing program requirements (see \cf3 23.107\cf2 ); and (2) Prioritize multi-attribute sustainable products and services (see \cf3 23.104\cf2 (c)(2)).\
(c) Regarding products under contract actions for services or construction, the contractor is required to provide products that meet the definition of sustainable products and services at \cf3 2.101\cf2 , if the products are\'97\
(1) Delivered to the Government;\
(2) Furnished by the contractor for use by the Government;\
(3) Incorporated into the construction of a public building or public work; or\
(4) Acquired by the contractor for use in performing services under a Government contract where the cost of the\
products is a direct cost to a Government contract (versus costs which are normally applied to a contractor's general and administrative expenses or indirect costs).\

\f0\b 23.104 General procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Maximum extent practicable. 
\f1\i0 If the requiring activity submits a written justification addressing the reasons described in \cf3 23.103\cf2 (a)(1), the contracting officer may consider it not practicable to procure sustainable products or services. A written justification may be for a specific product or service or at the line item or contract level. The contracting officer shall maintain the written justification in the contract file.\
(b) 
\f2\i Identification.\

\f1\i0 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the contracting officer shall ensure the solicitation and\
contract identifies\'97\
(i) The sustainable products and services, including the purchasing program and type of product or service, that are\
applicable to the acquisition, as identified by the requiring activity; and\
(ii) Any products and services that are not subject to the requirements of this subpart and the clause at \cf3 52.223-23\cf2 ,\
Sustainable Products and Services, based on the written justification under paragraph (a) of this section, an exception at \cf3 23.105\cf2 , or an exemption at \cf3 23.106\cf2 .\

(c) 
\f2\i Prioritization. 
\f1\i0 Agencies shall prioritize sustainable products and services as follows:\
(1) Procure products and services that meet applicable statutory purchasing program requirements (see \cf3 23.107\cf2 ). When\
both an EPA-designated item (see \cf3 23.107-1\cf2 ) and a biobased product in a USDA-designated product category (see \cf3 23.107-2\cf2 ) could be used for the same purposes, and there is not an EPA-designated item that is also a biobased product in a USDA- designated product category that meets the agency's needs, procure the EPA-designated item.\
(2) Consistent with other statutory procurement requirements, prioritize multi-attribute sustainable products and services, which are those that meet applicable statutory purchasing program requirements (see \cf3 23.107\cf2 ) and one or more required EPA purchasing programs (see \cf3 23.108\cf2 ).\
(3) If no statutory purchasing program requirements apply, procure sustainable products and services that meet required EPA purchasing program requirements (see \cf3 23.108\cf2 ).\

 24.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes policies and procedures that apply requirements of the Privacy Act of1974 (\cf3 5 U.S.C.552a\cf4 ) (the Act) and OMB CircularNo.A-130, December 12,1985, to Government contracts and cites the Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C.552\cf4 , as amended).\
 
\f0\b  24.101 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 24.1 - Protection of Individual Privacy\

\f2\i\b0\fs20 Agency 
\f1\i0 means any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\

\f2\i Individual 
\f1\i0 means a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\

\f2\i Maintain 
\f1\i0 means maintain, collect, use, or disseminate.\

\f2\i Operation of a system of records 
\f1\i0 means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the system of\
records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of records.\

\f2\i Personally identifiable information 
\f1\i0 means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity,\
either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. (See Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-130, Managing Federal Information as a Strategic Resource).\

\f2\i Record 
\f1\i0 means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history, and that contains the individual\'92s name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint or a photograph.\

\f2\i System of records on individuals 
\f1\i0 means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.\

\f0\b 24.102 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Act requires that when an agency contracts for the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals on behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency function the agency must apply the requirements of the Act to the contractor and its employees working on the contract.\
(b) An agency officer or employee may be criminally liable for violations of the Act. When the contract provides for operation of a system of records on individuals, contractors and their employees are considered employees of the agency for purposes of the criminal penalties of the Act.\
(c) If a contract specifically provides for the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals on behalf of an agency to accomplish an agency function, the agency must apply the requirements of the Act to the contractor and its employees working on the contract. The system of records operated under the contract is deemed to be maintained by the agency and is subject to the Act.\
(d) Agencies, which within the limits of their authorities, fail to require that systems of records on individuals operated on their behalf under contracts be operated in conformance with the Act may be civilly liable to individuals injured as a consequence of any subsequent failure to maintain records in conformance with the Act.\

\f0\b 24.103 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall review requirements to determine whether the contract will involve the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function.\
(b) If one or more of those tasks will be required, the contracting officer shall-\
(1) Ensure that the contract work statement specifically identifies the system of records on individuals and the design,\
development, or operation work to be performed; and\
(2) Make available, in accordance with agency procedures, agency rules and regulation implementing the Act.\

\f0\b 24.104 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 When the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals is required to accomplish an agency function, the contracting officer shall insert the following clauses in solicitations and contracts:\

\fs24 Subpart 24.2 - Freedom of Information Act\

\fs20 24.201 Authority.\

\f1\b0 The Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C.552\cf4 , as amended) provides that information is to be made available to the public either by-\
(a) Publication in the 
\f2\i Federal Register
\f1\i0 ;\
(b) Providing an opportunity to read and copy records at convenient locations; or (c) Upon request, providing a copy of a reasonably described record.\

\f0\b 24.202 Prohibitions.\

\f1\b0 (a) A proposal in the possession or control of the Government, submitted in response to a competitive solicitation, shall not be made available to any person under the Freedom of Information Act. This prohibition does not apply to a proposal, or any part of a proposal, that is set forth or incorporated by reference in a contract between the Government and the contractor that submitted the proposal. (See \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3309 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.4702\cf4 .)\
(b) No agency shall disclose any information obtained pursuant to \cf3 15.403-3\cf4 (b) that is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. (See \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3705(c)(3) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.3505(b)(3)\cf4 .)\
(c) A dispute resolution communication that is between a neutral person and a party to alternative dispute resolution proceedings, and that may not be disclosed under \cf3 5 U.S.C.574\cf4 , is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (\cf3 5 U.S.C.552(b)(3)\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 24.203 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Act specifies, among other things, how agencies shall make their records available upon public request, imposes strict time standards for agency responses, and exempts certain records from public disclosure. Each agency\'92s implementation of these requirements is located in its respective title of the 
\f2\i Code of Federal Regulations 
\f1\i0 and referenced in \cf3 subpart 24.2 \cf4 of its implementing acquisition regulations.\
(b) Contracting officers may receive requests for records that may be exempted from mandatory public disclosure. The exemptions most often applicable are those relating to classified information, to trade secrets and confidential commercial\
or financial information, to interagency or intra-agency memoranda, or to personal and medical information pertaining\
to an individual. Other exemptions include agency personnel practices, and law enforcement. Since these requests often involve complex issues requiring an in-depth knowledge of a large and increasing body of court rulings and policy guidance, contracting officers are cautioned to comply with the implementing regulations of their agency and to obtain necessary guidance from the agency officials having Freedom of Information Act responsibility. If additional assistance is needed, authorized agency officials may contact the Department of Justice, Office of Information and Privacy. A Freedom of Information Act guide and other resources are available at the Department of Justice website under FOIA reference materials: \cf3 http://www.usdoj.gov/oip\cf4 .\

(6) Procedures to be followed in the event of a suspected or confirmed breach of a system of records or unauthorized\
disclosure, access, handling, or use of personally identifiable information (see Office of Management and Budget guidance for Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information).\
(c) The contractor may provide its own training or use the training of another agency unless the contracting agency specifies that only its agency-provided training is acceptable (see \cf3 24.302\cf4 (b)).\
(d) The contractor is required to maintain and, upon request, to provide documentation of completion of privacy training for all applicable employees.\
(e) No contractor employee shall be permitted to have or retain access to a system of records, create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose, or otherwise handle personally identifiable information, or design, develop, maintain, or operate a system of records, unless the employee has completed privacy training that, at a minimum, addresses the elements in paragraph (b) of this section.\

\f0\b 24.302 Contract clause.\

\f0\b     25.002\
 25.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 (a) This part provides policies and procedures for-\
(1) Acquisition of foreign supplies, services, and construction materials; and (2) Contracts performed outside the United States.\
(b) It implements \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 83\cf4 , Buy American; trade agreements; and other laws and regulations.\

\f0\b 25.001 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 83\cf4 , Buy American-\
(1) Restricts the purchase of supplies, that are not domestic end products, for use within the United States. A foreign\
end product may be purchased if the contracting officer determines that the price of the lowest domestic offer is unreasonable or if another exception applies (see \cf3 subpart 25.1\cf4 ); and\
(2) Requires, with some exceptions, the use of only domestic construction materials in contracts for construction in the United States (see \cf3 subpart 25.2\cf4 ).\
(b) The restrictions in the Buy American statute are not applicable in acquisitions subject to certain trade agreements (see \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 ). In these acquisitions, end products and construction materials from certain countries receive nondiscriminatory treatment in evaluation with domestic offers. Generally, the dollar value of the acquisition determines which of the trade agreements applies. Exceptions to the applicability of the trade agreements are described in \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 .\
(c) The test to determine the country of origin for an end product under the Buy American statute (see the various country "end product" definitions in \cf3 25.003\cf4 ) is different from the test to determine the country of origin for an end product under\
the trade agreements, or the criteria for the representation on end products manufactured outside the United States (see \cf3 52.225-18\cf4 ).\
(1) The Buy American statute uses a two-part test to define a "domestic end product" or "domestic construction material" (manufactured in the United States and a domestic content test). The domestic content test has been waived for acquisition of commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items, except a product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both (excluding COTS fasteners) (see \cf3 25.101\cf4 (a) and \cf3 25.201\cf4 (b)).\
(2) Under the trade agreements, the test to determine country of origin is "substantial transformation" (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , transforming an article into a new and different article of commerce, with a name, character, or use distinct from the original article).\
(3) For the representation at \cf3 52.225-18\cf4 , the only criterion is whether the place of manufacture of an end product is in the United States or outside the United States, without regard to the origin of the components.\
(4) When using funds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5), the definition of "domestic manufactured construction material" requires manufacture in the United States but does not include a requirement with regard to the origin of the components. If the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel must be produced in the United States.\

\f2\i Cost of components 
\f1\i0 means-\

\fs24 Subpart 25.1 - Buy American-Supplies\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) This subpart implements-\
(1) \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 83\cf4 , Buy American;\
(2) Executive Order 10582, December 17, 1954;\
(3) Executive Order 13881, July 15, 2019;\
(4) \cf3 Executive Order 14005, \cf4 January 25, 2021; and\
(5) Waiver of the domestic content test of the Buy American statute for acquisition of commercially available off-the-\
shelf (COTS) items in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, but see \cf3 25.101\cf4 (a)(2)(ii).\
(b) It applies to supplies acquired for use in the United States, including supplies acquired under contracts set aside for\
small business concerns, if-\
(1) The supply contract exceeds the micro-purchase threshold; or\
(2) The supply portion of a contract for services that involves the furnishing of supplies (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , lease) exceeds the micro-\
purchase threshold.\

\f0\b 25.101 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Buy American statute restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured\
end products, the Buy American statute, \cf3 E.O. 13881, \cf4 and \cf3 E.O. 14005 \cf4 use a two-part test to define a domestic end product.\
(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and\
(2) (i) Except for an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of domestic components shall exceed 60 percent of the cost of all the components, except that the percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in calendar year 2029. But see paragraph (d) of this section. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, this domestic content test of the Buy American statute has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see \cf3 12.505\cf4 (a)) (but see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section).\
(ii) For an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost\
of foreign iron and steel must constitute less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product (see\
the definition of "foreign iron and steel" at \cf3 25.003\cf4 ). The cost of foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. This domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.\
(b) The Buy American statute applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the domestic content test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\
(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at \cf3 25.103\cf4 . The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in \cf3 subpart 25.5 \cf4 .\
(d) (1) A contract with a period of performance that spans the schedule of domestic content threshold increases specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall be required to comply with each increased threshold for the items in the year of delivery, unless the senior procurement executive of the contracting agency allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for that contract under which the domestic content threshold in effect at time of contract award will apply to the entire period of performance for the contract. This authority is not delegable. The senior procurement executive shall consult the Office of Management and Budget's Made in America Office before allowing the use of the alternate domestic content test.\
(2) When a senior procurement executive allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for a contract\'97 (i) See \cf3 25.1101\cf4 (a)(1)(ii) or \cf3 25.1101\cf4 (b)(1)(v) for use of the appropriate Alternate clause to reflect the domestic\
content threshold that will apply to the entire period of performance for that contract; and\
(ii) Use the fill-in at \cf3 52.213-4\cf4 (b)(1)(xvii)(B) instead of including \cf3 52.225-1 \cf4 Alternate I when using \cf3 52.213-4\cf4 , Terms\
and Conditions\'97Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services).\

\f0\b 25.103 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting officer may acquire a foreign end product without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute:\
(a) 
\f2\i Public interest. 
\f1\i0 The head of the agency may make a determination that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest. This exception applies when an agency has an agreement with a foreign government that provides a blanket exception to the Buy American statute.\
(b) 
\f2\i Nonavailability
\f1\i0 . The Buy American statute does not apply with respect to articles, materials, or supplies if articles, materials, or supplies of the class or kind to be acquired, either as end items or components, are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.\
(1) 
\f2\i Class determinations
\f1\i0 . (i) A nonavailability determination has been made for the articles listed in \cf3 25.104\cf4 . This determination does not necessarily mean that there is no domestic source for the listed items, but that domestic sources can only meet 50 percent or less of total U.S. Government and nongovernment demand.\
(ii) Before acquisition of an article on the list, the procuring agency is responsible to conduct market research appropriate to the circumstances, including seeking of domestic sources. This applies to acquisition of an article as-\
(A) An end product; or\
(B) A significant component (valued at more than 50 percent of the value of all the components).\
(iii) The determination in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply if the contracting officer learns at any\
time before the time designated for receipt of bids in sealed bidding or final offers in negotiation that an article on the list is available domestically in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality to meet the requirements of the solicitation. The contracting officer must-\
(A) Ensure that the appropriate Buy American statute provision and clause are included in the solicitation (see \cf3 25.1101\cf4 (a), \cf3 25.1101\cf4 (b), or \cf3 25.1102\cf4 );\
(B) Specify in the solicitation that the article is available domestically and that offerors and contractors may not treat foreign components of the same class or kind as domestic components; and\
(C) Submit a copy of supporting documentation to the appropriate council identified in \cf3 1.201-1\cf4 , in accordance with agency procedures, for possible removal of the article from the list.\
(2) 
\f2\i Individual determinations. 
\f1\i0 (i) The head of the contracting activity may make a determination that an article, material, or supply is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. A determination is not required before January 1, 2030, if there is an offer for a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content (see \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(2) and \cf3 25.106\cf4 (c)(2)).\
(ii) If the contracting officer considers that the nonavailability of an article is likely to affect future acquisitions, the contracting officer may submit a copy of the determination and supporting documentation to the appropriate council identified in \cf3 1.201-1\cf4 , in accordance with agency procedures, for possible addition to the list in \cf3 25.104\cf4 .\
(3) A written determination is not required if all of the following conditions are present: (i) The acquisition was conducted through use of full and open competition.\
(ii) The acquisition was synopsized in accordance with \cf3 5.201\cf4 .\
(iii) No offer for a domestic end product was received.\
(c) 
\f2\i Unreasonable cost
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer may determine that the cost of a domestic end product would be unreasonable, in accordance with \cf3 25.106 \cf4 and \cf3 subpart 25.5\cf4 .\
(d) 
\f2\i Resale
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer may purchase foreign end products specifically for commissary resale.\
(e) 
\f2\i Information technology that is a commercial product. 
\f1\i0 The restriction on purchasing foreign end products does not apply to the acquisition of information technology that is a commercial product, when using fiscal year 2004 or subsequent fiscal year funds (section 535(a) of Division F, Title V, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts).\

(B) Determine the reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the evaluation factors listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to the low offer.\
(ii) The price of the lowest offer of a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)(1)(i) of this section.

 25.200 Scope of subpart.\

\fs24 Subpart 25.2 - Buy American-Construction Materials\

\f1\b0\fs20 (a) This subpart implements-\
(1) \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 83\cf4 , Buy American;\
(2) Executive Order 10582, December 17, 1954;\
(3) Executive Order 13881, July 15, 2019;\
(4) \cf3 Executive Order 14005, \cf4 January 25, 2021; and\
(5) Waiver of the domestic content test of the Buy American statute for acquisitions of commercially available off-the-\
shelf (COTS) items in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, but see \cf3 25.201\cf4 (b)(2)(ii).\
(b) It applies to contracts for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work in the United\
States.\
(c) When using funds appropriated or otherwise provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub.\
L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) for construction, see \cf3 subpart 25.6\cf4 .\

\f0\b 25.201 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except as provided in \cf3 25.202\cf4 , use only domestic construction materials in construction contracts performed in the United States.\
(b) The Buy American statute restricts the purchase of construction materials that are not domestic construction materials. For manufactured construction materials, the Buy American statute, \cf3 E.O. 13881, \cf4 and \cf3 E.O. 14005 \cf4 use a two-part test to define domestic construction materials.\
(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and\
(2) (i) Except for construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of domestic components must exceed 60 percent of the cost of all the components, except that the percentage will\
be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in calendar year 2029, but see paragraph (c) of this section. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, this domestic content test of the Buy American statute has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see \cf3 12.505\cf4 (a)).\
(ii) For construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of foreign iron and steel must constitute less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in such construction material (see the definition of "foreign iron and steel" at \cf3 25.003\cf4 ). The cost of foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. This domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.\
(c) (1) A contract with a period of performance that spans the schedule of domestic content threshold increases specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be required to comply with each increased threshold for the items in the year of delivery, unless the senior procurement executive of the contracting agency allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for that contract under which the domestic content threshold in effect at time of contract award will apply to the entire period of performance for the contract. This authority is not delegable. The senior procurement executive shall consult the Office of Management and Budget's Made in America Office before allowing the use of the alternate domestic content test.\
(2) When a senior procurement executive allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for a contract, see \cf3 25.1102\cf4 (a)(3) or (c)(4) for use of the appropriate Alternate clause to reflect the domestic content threshold that will apply to the entire period of performance for that contract.\

\f0\b 25.202 Exceptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting officer may allow the contractor to acquire foreign construction materials without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute:\
(1) 
\f2\i Impracticable or inconsistent with public interest
\f1\i0 . The head of the agency may determine that application of the restrictions of the Buy American statute to a particular construction material would be impracticable or would be inconsistent with the public interest. The public interest exception applies when an agency has an agreement with a foreign government that provides a blanket exception to the Buy American statute.\

\fs20 (2) 
\f2\i Nonavailability
\f1\i0 . The head of the contracting activity may determine that a particular construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. The determinations of nonavailability of the articles listed at \cf3 25.104\cf4 (a) and the procedures at \cf3 25.103\cf4 (b) (1) also apply if any of those articles are acquired as construction materials. A determination is not required before January 1, 2030, if there is an offer for a foreign construction material that exceeds 55 percent domestic content (see \cf3 25.204\cf4 (b)(1)(ii) and \cf3 25.204\cf4 (b)(2)(ii)).\
(3) 
\f2\i Unreasonable cost
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer concludes that the cost of domestic construction material is unreasonable in accordance with \cf3 25.204\cf4 .\
(4) 
\f2\i Information technology that is a commercial product. 
\f1\i0 The restriction on purchasing foreign construction material does not apply to the acquisition of information technology that is a commercial product, when using Fiscal Year 2004 or subsequent fiscal year funds (section 535(a) of Division F, Title V, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts).\
(b) 
\f2\i Determination and findings
\f1\i0 . When a determination is made for any of the reasons stated in this section that certain foreign construction materials may be used, the contracting officer must list the excepted materials in the contract. The agency must make the findings justifying the exception available for public inspection.\
(c) 
\f2\i Acquisitions under trade agreements
\f1\i0 . For construction contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $6,708,000 or more, see \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 .\

\f0\b 25.203 Preaward determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) For any acquisition, an offeror may request from the contracting officer a determination concerning the inapplicability of the Buy American statute for specifically identified construction materials. The time for submitting the request is specified in the solicitation in paragraph (b) of either \cf3 52.225-10 \cf4 or \cf3 52.225-12\cf4 , whichever applies. The information and supporting\
data that must be included in the request are also specified in the solicitation in paragraphs (c) and (d) of either \cf3 52.225-9 \cf4 or \cf3 52.225-11\cf4 , whichever applies.\
(b) Before award, the contracting officer must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information.\

\f0\b 25.204 Evaluating offers of foreign construction material.\

\f1\b0 (a) Offerors proposing to use foreign construction material other than that listed by the Government in the applicable clause at \cf3 52.225-9\cf4 , paragraph (b)(2), or \cf3 52.225-11\cf4 , paragraph (b)(3), or covered by the WTO GPA or a Free Trade Agreement (paragraph (b)(2) of \cf3 52.225-11\cf4 ), must provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the respective clauses.\
(b)\
(1) 
\f2\i For construction material that is not a critical item and does not contain critical components
\f1\i0 .\
(i) Unless the head of the agency specifies a higher percentage, the contracting officer shall add to the offered price 20 percent of the cost of any foreign construction material proposed for exception from the requirements of the Buy American statute based on the unreasonable cost of domestic construction materials. In the case of a tie, the contracting officer shall give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.\
(ii) For construction material that is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section result in an unreasonable cost determination for the domestic construction material offer or there is no domestic construction material offer received, and the low offer is for foreign construction material that does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the contracting officer shall\'97\
(A) Treat the lowest offer of foreign construction material that is manufactured in the United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer; and\
(B) Determine the reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph (b) (1)(i) to the low offer.\
(iii) The procedures in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030. (2) 
\f2\i For construction material that is a critical item or contains critical components
\f1\i0 .\
(i) The contracting officer shall add to the offered price 20 percent, plus the additional preference factor identified for the critical item or construction material containing critical components listed at section \cf3 25.105\cf4 , of the cost of any foreign construction material proposed for exception from the requirements of the Buy American statute based on the unreasonable cost of domestic construction materials. In the case of a tie, the contracting officer shall give preference to an offer that does\

\f1\b0 not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost. See \cf3 25.105 \cf4 for the list of critical components and critical items.\
(ii) For construction material that is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section result in an unreasonable cost determination for the domestic construction material offer or there is no domestic construction material offer received, and the low offer is for foreign construction material that does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the contracting officer shall\'97\
(A) Treat the lowest offer of foreign construction material that is manufactured in the United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer; and\
(B) Determine the reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the evaluation factors listed in this paragraph (b)(2) to the low offer.\
(iii) The procedures in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030.\
(c) Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible\
rejection of the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply.\
(d) If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(2) of \cf3 52.225-9\cf4 , or paragraph (b)(3) of \cf3 52.225-11\cf4 ), the contracting officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract clause.\

\f0\b 25.205 Postaward determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a contractor requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American statute after contract award, the contractor must explain why it could not request the determination before contract award or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the contracting officer concludes that the contractor should have made the request before contract award, the contracting officer may deny the request.\
(b) The contracting officer must base evaluation of any request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American statute made after contract award on information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the applicable clause at \cf3 52.225-9 \cf4 or \cf3 52.225-11 \cf4 and/or other readily available information.\
(c) If a determination, under \cf3 25.202\cf4 (a), is made after contract award that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, the contracting officer must negotiate adequate consideration and modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is at least the differential established in \cf3 25.202\cf4 (a) or in accordance with agency procedures.\

\f0\b 25.206 Noncompliance.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer must-\
(a) Review allegations of Buy American statute violations;\
(b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the contractor of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign construction material and\
request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and\
(c) If the review reveals that a contractor or subcontractor has used foreign construction material without authorization,\
take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:\
(1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of the Buy American statute in accordance with \cf3 25.205\cf4 . (2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign construction material.\
(3) If removal and replacement of foreign construction material incorporated in a building or work would be\
impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Government, the contracting officer may determine in writing that the foreign construction material need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign construction material does not constitute a determination that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign construction material does not affect the Government\'92s right to suspend or debar a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier for violation of the Buy American statute, or to exercise other contractual rights and remedies, such as reducing the contract price or terminating the contract for default.\
(4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate contractual remedies, such as terminating the contract for default. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 . If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the officer responsible for criminal investigation.\

\f0\b 25.402 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) The Trade Agreements Act (\cf3 19 U.S.C.2501\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq
\f1\i0 .) provides the authority for the President to waive the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products from countries that have signed an international trade agreement with the United States, or that meet certain other criteria, such as being a least developed country. The President has delegated this waiver authority to the U.S. Trade Representative. In acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, Free Trade Agreements, or the Israeli Trade Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has waived the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products. Offers of eligible products receive equal consideration with domestic offers.\
(2) The contracting officer shall determine the origin of services by the country in which the firm providing the services is established. See \cf3 subpart 25.5 \cf4 for evaluation procedures for supply contracts covered by trade agreements.\
(b) The value of the acquisition is a determining factor in the applicability of trade agreements. Most of these dollar thresholds are subject to revision by the U.S. Trade Representative approximately every 2 years. The various thresholds are summarized as follows:\
 \cf2    Trade Agreement\
       Supply Contract (equal to or exceeding)\
     Service Contract (equal to or exceeding)\

\f0\b   25.403 World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Eligible products from WTO GPA and FTA countries are entitled to the nondiscriminatory treatment specified in\
\cf3 25.402\cf4 (a)(1). The WTO GPA and FTAs specify procurement procedures designed to ensure fairness (see \cf3 25.408\cf4 ).\
(b) 
\f2\i Thresholds. 
\f1\i0 (1) To determine whether the acquisition of products by lease, rental, or lease-purchase contract (including\
lease-to-ownership, or lease-with-option-to purchase) is covered by the WTO GPA or an FTA, calculate the estimated acquisition value as follows:\
(i) If a fixed-term contract of 12 months or less is contemplated, use the total estimated value of the acquisition.\
(ii) If a fixed-term contract of more than 12 months is contemplated, use the total estimated value of the acquisition plus the estimated residual value of the leased equipment at the conclusion of the contemplated term of the contract.\
(iii) If an indefinite-term contract is contemplated, use the estimated monthly payment multiplied by the total number of months that ordering would be possible under the proposed contract, 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 the initial ordering period plus any optional ordering periods.\
(iv) If there is any doubt as to the contemplated term of the contract, use the estimated monthly payment multiplied by 48.\
(2) The estimated value includes the value of all options.\
(3) If, in any 12-month period, recurring or multiple awards for the same type of product or products are anticipated, use the total estimated value of these projected awards to determine whether the WTO GPA or an FTA applies. Do not divide any acquisition with the intent of reducing the estimated value of the acquisition below the dollar threshold of the WTO GPA or an FTA.\
(c) 
\f2\i Purchase restriction. 
\f1\i0 (1) Under the Trade Agreements Act (\cf3 19 U.S.C. 2512\cf4 ), in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, acquire only U.S.-made or designated country end products or U.S. or designated country services, unless offers for such end products or services are either not received or are insufficient to fulfill the requirements. This purchase restriction does not apply below the WTO GPA threshold for supplies and services, even if the acquisition is covered by an FTA.\
(2) This restriction does not apply to purchases of supplies by the Department of Defense from a country with which it has entered into a reciprocal agreement, as provided in departmental regulations.\

\f0\b 25.404 Least developed countries.\

\f1\b0 For acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, least developed country end products, construction material, and services must be treated as eligible products.\

\f0\b 25.405 Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative.\

\f1\b0 Under the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative, the United States Trade Representative has determined that, for acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, Caribbean Basin country end products, construction material, and services must be treated as eligible products. In accordance with Section 201 (a)(3) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Implementation Act (Pub. L. 109-53) (19 U.S.C. 4031), when the CAFTA-DR agreement enters into force with respect to a country, that country is no longer designated as a beneficiary country for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, and is therefore no longer included in the definition of "Caribbean Basin country" for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative.\

 25.406 Israeli Trade Act.\

\f1\b0 Acquisitions of supplies by most agencies are covered by the Israeli Trade Act, if the estimated value of the acquisition\
is $50,000 or more but does not exceed the WTO GPA threshold for supplies (see \cf3 25.402\cf4 (b)). Agencies other than the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and the Office of Thrift Supervision must evaluate offers of Israeli end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Israeli Trade Act does not prohibit the purchase of other foreign end products.\

\f0\b 25.407 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.\

\f1\b0 Under the authority of Section 303 of the Trade Agreements Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has waived the Buy American statute for civil aircraft and related articles that meet the substantial transformation test of the Trade Agreements Act, from countries that are parties to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Those countries are Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macao China, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (Chinese Taipei), and the United Kingdom.\

\f0\b 25.408 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the WTO GPA or an FTA applies (see \cf3 25.401\cf4 ), the contracting officer must-\
(1) Comply with the requirements of \cf3 5.203\cf4 , Publicizing and response time;\
(2) Comply with the requirements of \cf3 5.207\cf4 , Preparation and transmittal of synopses;\
(3) Not include technical requirements in solicitations solely to preclude the acquisition of eligible products;\
(4) Specify in solicitations that offerors must submit offers in the English language and in U.S. dollars (see \cf3 52.214-34\cf4 ,\
Submission of Offers in the English Language, and \cf3 52.214-35\cf4 , Submission of Offers in U.S. Currency, or paragraph (c)(5) of \cf3 52.215-1\cf4 , Instruction to Offerors-Competitive Acquisitions); and\
(5) Provide unsuccessful offerors from WTO GPA or FTA countries notice in accordance with \cf3 14.409-1 \cf4 or \cf3 15.503\cf4 . (b) See \cf3 subpart 25.5 \cf4 for evaluation procedures and examples.\

 25.501 General.\

\fs24 Subpart 25.5 - Evaluating Foreign Offers-Supply Contracts\

\f1\b0\fs20 The contracting officer-\
(a) Must apply the evaluation procedures of this subpart to each line item of an offer unless either the offer or the solicitation specifies evaluation on a group basis (see \cf3 25.503\cf4 );\
(b) May rely on the offeror\'92s certification of end product origin when evaluating a foreign offer;\
(c) Must identify and reject offers of end products that are prohibited in accordance with \cf3 subpart 25.7\cf4 ; and\
(d) When trade agreements are involved, must not use the Buy American statute evaluation factors prescribed in this\
subpart to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another foreign offer.\

\f0\b 25.502 Application.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unless otherwise specified in agency regulations, perform the following steps in the order presented:\
(1) Eliminate all offers or offerors that are unacceptable for reasons other than price; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 nonresponsive, debarred or\
suspended, or a prohibited source (see \cf3 subpart 25.7\cf4 ).\
(2) Rank the remaining offers by price.\
(3) If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors\
as specified in this section and use the evaluated cost or price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government.\
(b) For acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA (see \cf3 subpart 25.4\cf4 )-\
(1) Consider only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products, unless no offers of such end products were\
received;\
(2) If the agency gives the same consideration given eligible offers to offers of U.S.-made end products that are not\
domestic end products, award on the low offer. Otherwise, evaluate in accordance with agency procedures; and\
(3) If there were no offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products, make a nonavailability determination (see\
\cf3 25.103\cf4 (b)(2)) and award on the low offer (see \cf3 25.403\cf4 (c)).\
(c) For acquisitions not covered by the WTO GPA, but subject to the Buy American statute (an FTA or the Israeli Trade\
Act also may apply), the following applies:\
(1) If the low offer is a domestic offer or an eligible offer under an FTA or the Israeli Trade Act, award on that offer. (2) If the low offer is a noneligible offer and there were no domestic offers (see \cf3 25.103\cf4 (b)(3)), award on the low offer.\
The procedures at \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(2) and \cf3 25.106\cf4 (c)(2) do not apply.\
(3) If the low offer is a noneligible offer and there is an eligible offer that is lower than the lowest domestic offer, award\
on the low offer. The procedures at \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(2) and \cf3 25.106\cf4 (c)(2) do not apply.\
(4) Otherwise, apply the appropriate evaluation factor provided in \cf3 25.106 \cf4 to the low offer. The procedures at \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)\
(2) and \cf3 25.106\cf4 (c)(2) do not apply.\
(i) If the evaluated price of the low offer remains less than the lowest domestic offer, award on the low offer. (ii) If the price of the lowest domestic offer is less than the evaluated price of the low offer, award on the lowest\
domestic offer.\
(d) 
\f2\i Ties. 
\f1\i0 (1) If application of an evaluation factor results in a tie between a domestic offer and a foreign offer, award on\
the domestic offer.\
(2) If no evaluation preference was applied (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 offers afforded nondiscriminatory treatment under the Buy American\
statute), resolve ties between domestic and foreign offers by a witnessed drawing of lots by an impartial individual.\
(3) Resolve ties between foreign offers from small business concerns (under the Buy American statute, a small business offering a manufactured article that does not meet the definition of "domestic end product" is a foreign offer) or foreign offers\
from a small business concern and a large business concern in accordance with \cf3 14.408-6\cf4 (a).\

\f0\b 25.503 Group offers.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the solicitation or an offer specifies that award can be made only on a group of line items or on all line items contained in the solicitation or offer, reject the offer-\
(1) If any part of the award would consist of prohibited end products (see \cf3 subpart 25.7\cf4 ); or\
(2) If the acquisition is covered by the WTO GPA and any part of the offer consists of items restricted in accordance with \cf3 25.403\cf4 (c).\

\fs20 (b) If an offer restricts award to a group of line items or to all line items contained in the offer, determine for each line item whether to apply an evaluation factor (see \cf3 25.504-4\cf4 , Example 1).\
(1) First, evaluate offers that do not specify an award restriction on a line item basis in accordance with \cf3 25.502\cf4 , determining a tentative award pattern by selecting for each line item the offer with the lowest evaluated price.\
(2) Evaluate an offer that specifies an award restriction against the offered prices of the tentative award pattern, applying the appropriate evaluation factor on a line item basis.\
(3) Compute the total evaluated price for the tentative award pattern and the offer that specified an award restriction.\
(4) Unless the total evaluated price of the offer that specified an award restriction is less than the total evaluated price of the tentative award pattern, award based on the tentative award pattern.\
(c) If the solicitation specifies that award will be made only on a group of line items or all line items contained in the solicitation, determine the category of end products on the basis of each line item, but determine whether to apply an evaluation factor on the basis of the group of items (see \cf3 25.504-4\cf4 , Example 2).\
(1) If the proposed price of domestic end products exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group, evaluate the entire group as a domestic offer. Evaluate all other groups as foreign offers.\
(2) For foreign offers, if the proposed price of domestic end products and eligible products exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group, evaluate the entire group as an eligible offer.\
(3) Apply the evaluation factor to the entire group in accordance with \cf3 25.502\cf4 .\
(d) If no trade agreement applies to a solicitation and the solicitation specifies that award will be made only on a group\
of line items or all line items contained in the solicitation, determine the category of end products ( 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 domestic or foreign) on the basis of each line item, but determine whether to apply an evaluation factor on the basis of the group of items ( 
\f2\i see 
\f1\i0 \cf3 25.504-4\cf4 (c), Example 3).\
(1) If the proposed price of domestic end products exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group, evaluate the entire group as a domestic offer. Evaluate all other groups as foreign offers.\
(2) Apply the evaluation factor to the entire group in accordance with \cf3 25.502\cf4 , except where \cf3 25.502\cf4 (c)(4) applies and the evaluated price of the low offer remains less than the lowest domestic offer. Where the evaluated price of the low offer remains less than the lowest domestic offer, treat as a domestic offer any group where the proposed price of end products with a domestic content of at least 55 percent exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group.\
(3) Apply the evaluation factor to the entire group in accordance with \cf3 25.502\cf4 (c)(4).\

\f0\b 25.504 Evaluation examples.\

\f1\b0 The following examples illustrate the application of the evaluation procedures in \cf3 25.502 \cf4 and \cf3 25.503\cf4 . The examples assume that the contracting officer has eliminated all offers that are unacceptable for reasons other than price or a trade agreement (see \cf3 25.502\cf4 (a)(1)). The evaluation factor may change as provided in agency regulations.\

\f2\i Analysis: 
\f1\i0 This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $50,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in \cf3 25.502\cf4 (a). Offer C is of 50 percent domestic content, therefore Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product, because it is the product of a small business but is not a domestic end product ( 
\f2\i see 
\f1\i0 \cf3 25.502\cf4 (c)(4)). Since Offer B is a domestic offer, apply the 30 percent factor to Offer C ( 
\f2\i see 
\f1\i0 \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(2)). The resulting evaluated price of $13,130 remains lower than Offer B. The cost of Offer B is therefore unreasonable ( 
\f2\i see 
\f1\i0 \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(1)(ii)). The \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(2) procedures do not apply. Award on Offer C at $10,100 ( 
\f2\i see

\f1\i0 : This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Perform the steps in \cf3 25.502\cf4 (a). Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product because it is the product of a small business but is not a domestic end product (see \cf3 25.502\cf4 (c)(4)).

\f2\i Analysis. 
\f1\i0 This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $50,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in \cf3 25.502\cf4 (a). Offers B and C are initially evaluated as foreign end products, because they are the products of small businesses but are not domestic end products ( 
\f2\i see 
\f1\i0 \cf3 25.502\cf4 (c)(4)). Offer C is the low offer. After applying the 30 percent factor, the evaluated price of Offer C is $13,130. The resulting evaluated price of $13,130 remains lower than Offer A. The cost of Offer A is therefore unreasonable. Offer B is then treated as a domestic offer, because it is for a U.S.-made end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content ( 
\f2\i see 
\f1\i0 \cf3 25.106\cf4 (b)(2)). Offer B is determined reasonable because it is lower than the $13,130 evaluated price of Offer C. Award on Offer B at $12,500.\

\f2\i             Analysis
\f1\i0 : Eliminate Offer D because the acquisition is covered by the WTO GPA and there is an offer of a U.S.-made or an eligible product (see \cf3 25.502\cf4 (b)(1)). If the agency gives the same consideration given eligible offers to offers of U.S.-made end products that are not domestic offers, it is unnecessary to determine if U.S.-made end products are domestic (large or small business). No further analysis is necessary. Award on the low remaining offer, Offer C (see \cf3 25.502\cf4 (b)(2)).\

price of Offer A is higher than Offer B; select B.\

\f2\i Item 4
\f1\i0 : Low offer A is noneligible. Since neither offer is a domestic offer, no evaluation factor applies; select A.

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 25.6 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Buy American statute-Construction Materials\

\fs20 25.600 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart implements section 1605 in Division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) with regard to manufactured construction material and the \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 83\cf4 , Buy American (referred to in this subpart as the Buy American statute) with regard to unmanufactured construction material. It applies to construction projects that use funds appropriated or otherwise provided by the Recovery Act.\

\f0\b 25.601 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Domestic construction material 
\f1\i0 means the following:\
(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States. (The Buy American statute applies.)\
(2) A manufactured construction material that is manufactured in the United States and, if the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel was produced in the United States. (Section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies.)\

\f2\i Foreign construction material 
\f1\i0 means a construction material other than a domestic construction material.\

\f2\i Manufactured construction material 
\f1\i0 means any construction material that is not unmanufactured construction material. 
\f2\i Public building or public work 
\f1\i0 means a building or work, the construction, prosecution, completion, or repair of which is\
carried on directly or indirectly by authority of, or with funds of, a Federal agency to serve the interest of the general public regardless of whether title thereof is in a Federal agency (see \cf3 22.401\cf4 ). These buildings and works may include, without limitation, bridges, dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers, mains, power lines, pumping stations, heavy generators, railways, airports, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys, jetties, breakwaters, levees, and canals, and the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of such buildings and works.\

\f2\i Recovery Act designated country 
\f1\i0 means a World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement country, a Free Trade Agreement country, or a least developed country.\

\f2\i Unmanufactured construction material 
\f1\i0 means raw material brought to the construction site for incorporation into the building or work that has not been-\
(1) Processed into a specific form and shape; or\
(2) Combined with other raw material to create a material that has different properties than the properties of the individual raw materials.\

\f0\b 25.602 Policy.\
25.602-1 Section 1605 of the Recovery Act.\

\f1\b0 Except as provided in \cf3 25.603\cf4 -\
(a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the Recovery Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work unless the public building or public work is located in the United States and-\
(1) All of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used as construction material in the project are produced or manufactured in the United States.\
(i) All manufactured construction material must be manufactured in the United States.\
(ii) 
\f2\i Iron or steel components
\f1\i0 . (A) Iron or steel components of construction material consisting wholly or predominantly of iron or steel must be produced in the United States. This does not restrict the origin of the elements of the iron or steel, but requires that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives.\
(B) The requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to iron or steel components or subcomponents in construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel.\

(i) 
\f2\i Nonavailability
\f1\i0 . The head of the contracting activity may determine that a particular construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.

(2) In addition, the head of the agency may determine that application of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured construction material would be impracticable.\
(b) 
\f2\i Determinations
\f1\i0 . When a determination is made, for any of the reasons stated in this section, that certain foreign construction materials may be used-\
(1) The contracting officer shall list the excepted materials in the contract; and\
(2) For determinations with regard to the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act, unless the construction material has already been determined to be domestically nonavailable (see list at \cf3 25.104\cf4 ), the head of the agency shall provide a notice to the Federal Register within three business days after the determination is made, with a copy to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy and to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. The notice shall include-\
(i) The title "Buy American Exception under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"; (ii) The dollar value and brief description of the project; and\
(iii) A detailed justification as to why the restriction is being waived.\

\f1\b0 for submitting the request is specified in the solicitation in paragraph (b) of either \cf3 52.225-22 \cf4 or \cf3 52.225-24\cf4 , whichever applies. The information and supporting data that must be included in the request are also specified in the solicitation in paragraphs (c) and (d) of either \cf3 52.225-21 \cf4 or \cf3 52.225-23\cf4 , whichever applies.\
(b) Before award, the contracting officer must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information.\
(c) Determination based on unreasonable cost of domestic construction material.\
(1) 
\f2\i Manufactured construction material
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer must compare the offered price of the contract\
using foreign manufactured construction material (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , any construction material not manufactured in the United States, or construction material consisting predominantly of iron or steel and the iron or steel is not produced in the United States) to the estimated price if all domestic manufactured construction material were used. If use of domestic manufactured construction material would increase the overall offered price of the contract by more than 25 percent, then the contracting officer shall determine that the cost of the domestic manufactured construction material is unreasonable\
(2) 
\f2\i Unmanufactured construction material
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer must compare the cost of each foreign unmanufactured construction material to the cost of domestic unmanufactured construction material. If the cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material exceeds the cost of the foreign unmanufactured construction material by more than 20 percent, then the contracting officer shall determine that the cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material is unreasonable.\

\f0\b 25.605 Evaluating offers of foreign construction material.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the contracting officer has determined that an exception applies because the cost of certain domestic construction material is unreasonable, in accordance with section \cf3 25.604\cf4 , then the contracting officer shall apply evaluation factors to the offer incorporating the use of such foreign construction material as follows:\
(1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total offered price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction material is incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic construction material requested by the offeror.\
(2) In addition, use an evaluation factor of 20 percent applied to the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured construction material requested by the offeror.\
(3) Total evaluated price = offered price + (.25 x offered price, if (a)(1) applies) + (.20 x cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material, if (a)(2) applies).\
(b) If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and use the evaluated price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government\
(c) Unless paragraph (b) applies, if two or more offers are equal in price, the contracting officer must give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.\
(d) Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible rejection of the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply.\
(e) If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(3) of \cf3 52.225-21\cf4 , or paragraph (b)(3) of \cf3 52.225-23\cf4 ), the contracting officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract clause.\

\f0\b 25.606 Postaward determinations.\

\f1\b0 (a) If a contractor requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute after contract award, the contractor must explain why it could not request the determination before contract award or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the contracting officer concludes that the contractor should have made the request before contract award, the contracting officer may deny the request.\
(b) The contracting officer must base evaluation of any request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute made after contract award on information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the applicable clause at \cf3 52.225-21 \cf4 or \cf3 52.225-23 \cf4 and/or other readily available information.\
(c) If a determination, under \cf3 25.603\cf4 (a), is made after contract award that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or to the Buy American statute applies, the contracting officer must negotiate adequate consideration and modify the contract\

\fs20 to allow use of the foreign construction material. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of a domestic\
construction material, adequate consideration is at least the differential established in \cf3 25.605\cf4 (a).\

\f0\b 25.607 Noncompliance.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer must-\
(a) Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or Buy American statute;\
(b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the contractor of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign construction material and\
request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and\
(c) If the review reveals that a contractor or subcontractor has used foreign construction material without authorization,\
take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:\
(1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American\
statute in accordance with \cf3 25.606\cf4 .\
(2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign construction material.\
(3) If removal and replacement of foreign construction material incorporated in a building or work would be\
impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Government, the contracting officer may determine in writing that the foreign construction material need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign construction material does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign construction material does not affect the Government\'92s right to suspend or debar a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier\
for violation of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute, or to exercise other contractual rights and remedies, such as reducing the contract price or terminating the contract for default.\
(4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate contractual remedies, such as terminating the contract for default. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with subpart \cf3 9.4\cf4 . If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the agency\'92s inspector general or the officer responsible for criminal investigation.\

\fs24 Subpart 25.9 - Customs and Duties\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart provides policies and procedures for exempting from import duties certain supplies purchased under Government contracts.\

\f0\b 25.901 Policy.\

\f1\b0 United States laws impose duties on foreign supplies imported into the customs territory of the United States. Certain exemptions from these duties are available to Government agencies. Agencies must use these exemptions when the anticipated savings to appropriated funds will outweigh the administrative costs associated with processing required documentation.\

\f0\b 25.902 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 For regulations governing importations and duties, see the Customs Regulations issued by the U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury (19 CFR Chapter 1). Except as provided elsewhere in the Customs Regulations (see 19 CFR 10.100), all shipments of imported supplies purchased under Government contracts are subject to the usual Customs entry and examination requirements. Unless the agency obtains an exemption (see \cf3 25.903\cf4 ), those shipments are also subject to duty.\

\f0\b 25.903 Exempted supplies.\

\f1\b0 (a) Subchapters VIII and X of Chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\cf3 19 U.S.C. 1202\cf4 ) list supplies for which exemptions from duty may be obtained when imported into the customs territory of the United States under a Government contract. For certain of these supplies, the contracting agency must certify to the Commissioner of Customs that they are for the purpose stated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (see 19 CFR 10.102-104, 10.114, and 10.121 and 15 CFR Part 301 for requirements and formats).\
(b) Supplies (excluding equipment) for Government-operated vessels or aircraft may be withdrawn from any customs- bonded warehouse, from continuous customs custody elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse, or from a foreign-trade zone, free of duty and internal revenue tax as provided in \cf3 19 U.S.C. 1309 \cf4 and \cf3 1317\cf4 . The contracting activity must cite this authority on the appropriate customs form when making purchases (see 19 CFR 10.59 - 10.65).\

\fs20 25.1001 Waiver of right to examination of records.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Policy
\f1\i0 . The clause at \cf3 52.215-2\cf4 , Audit and Records-Negotiation, prescribed at \cf3 15.209\cf4 (b), and paragraph (d) of the clause at \cf3 52.212-5\cf4 , Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, prescribed at \cf3 12.301\cf4 (b)(4), implement \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3841 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 4706\cf4 . The basic clauses authorize examination of records by the Comptroller General.\
(1) Insert the appropriate basic clause, whenever possible, in negotiated contracts with foreign contractors. (2) The contracting officer may use \cf3 52.215-2 \cf4 with its Alternate III or \cf3 52.212-5 \cf4 with its Alternate I after-\
(i) Exhausting all reasonable efforts to include the basic clause;\
(ii) Considering factors such as alternate sources of supply, additional cost, and time of delivery; and\
(iii) The head of the agency has executed a determination and findings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this\
section, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General. However, concurrence of the Comptroller General is not required if the contractor is a foreign government or agency thereof or is precluded by the laws of the country involved from making its records available for examination.\
(b) 
\f2\i Determination and findings
\f1\i0 . The determination and findings must-\
(1) Identify the contract and its purpose, and identify if the contract is with a foreign contractor or with a foreign\
government or an agency of a foreign government;\
(2) Describe the efforts to include the basic clause;\
(3) State the reasons for the contractor\'92s refusal to include the basic clause;\
(4) Describe the price and availability of the supplies or services from the United States and other sources; and\
(5) Determine that it will best serve the interest of the United States to use the appropriate alternate clause in paragraph\
(a)(2) of this section.\

\f0\b 25.1002 Use of foreign currency.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unless an international agreement or the WTO GPA (see \cf3 25.408\cf4 (a)(4)) requires a specific currency, contracting officers must determine whether solicitations for contracts to be entered into and performed outside the United States will require submission of offers in U.S. currency or a specified foreign currency. In unusual circumstances, the contracting officer may permit submission of offers in other than a specified currency.\
(b) To ensure a fair evaluation of offers, solicitations generally should require all offers to be priced in the same currency. However, if the solicitation permits submission of offers in other than a specified currency, the contracting officer must convert the offered prices to U.S. currency for evaluation purposes. The contracting officer must use the current market exchange rate from a commonly used source in effect as follows:\
(1) For acquisitions conducted using sealed bidding procedures, on the date of bid opening. (2) For acquisitions conducted using negotiation procedures-\
(i) On the date specified for receipt of offers, if award is based on initial offers; otherwise\
(ii) On the date specified for receipt of final proposal revisions.\
(c) If a contract is priced in foreign currency, the agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency\
fluctuations to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (\cf3 31 U.S.C. 1341\cf4 , \cf3 1342\cf4 , \cf3 1511-1519\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 25.1003 Tax on certain foreign procurements.\

\f1\b0 See \cf3 29.204 \cf4 for the imposition of the tax on certain foreign procurements pursuant to the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (\cf3 Pub. L. 111-347\cf4 ), \cf3 26 U.S.C. 5000 \cf4 C, and its implementing regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7.\

\fs20 26.100 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart implements \cf3 25 U.S.C.1544\cf4 , which provides an incentive to prime contractors that use Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as subcontractors.\

\f0\b 26.101 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Indian 
\f1\i0 means any person who is a member of any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community that is recognized by the Federal Government as eligible for services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in accordance with \cf3 25 U.S.C.1452(c) \cf4 and any "Native" as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (\cf3 43 U.S.C.1601\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Indian organization 
\f1\i0 means the governing body of any Indian tribe or entity established or recognized by the governing body of an Indian tribe for the purposes of \cf3 25 U.S.C., Chapter 17\cf4 .\

\f2\i Indian-owned economic enterprise 
\f1\i0 means any Indian-owned (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior) commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit, provided that Indian ownership constitutes not less than 51 percent of the enterprise.\

\f2\i Indian tribe 
\f1\i0 means any Indian tribe, band, pueblo, or community, including native villages and native groups (including corporations organized by Kenai, Juneau, Sitka, and Kodiak) as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, that is recognized by the Federal Government as eligible for services from BIA in accordance with \cf3 25 U.S.C.1452(c)\cf4 .\

\f2\i Interested party 
\f1\i0 means a prime contractor or an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a subcontract or by the failure to award a subcontract.\

\f0\b 26.102 Policy.\

\f1\b0 Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in performing contracts awarded by Federal agencies. In fulfilling this requirement, the Indian Incentive Program allows an incentive payment equal to 5 percent of the amount paid to a subcontractor in performing the contract, if the contract so authorizes and the subcontractor is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise.\

\fs24 Subpart 26.2 - Major Disaster or Emergency Assistance Activities\

\fs20 26.200 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart implements the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (\cf3 42U.S .C.5150\cf4 ), which provides a preference for local organizations, firms, and individuals when contracting for major disaster or emergency assistance activities.\

\f0\b 26.201 Definitions.\

\f2\i\b0 Emergency response contract 
\f1\i0 means a contract with private entities that supports assistance activities in a major disaster or emergency area, such as debris clearance, distribution of supplies, or reconstruction.\

\f2\i Local firm 
\f1\i0 means a private organization, firm, or individual residing or doing business primarily in a major disaster or emergency area.\

\f2\i Major disaster or emergency area 
\f1\i0 means the area included in the official Presidential declaration(s) and any additional areas identified by the Department of Homeland Security. Major disaster declarations and emergency declarations are published in the Federal Register and are available at \cf3 https://www.fema.gov/disasters/disaster/declarations\cf4 .\

\f0\b 26.202 Local area preference.\

\f1\b0 (a) When awarding emergency response contracts during the term of a major disaster or emergency declaration by the President of the United States under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (\cf3 42 U.S.C. 5121\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq
\f1\i0 .), preference shall be given, to the extent feasible and practicable, to local firms. Preference may be given through a local area set-aside or an evaluation preference.\
(b) When using the authority under the Stafford Act, see the definitions of "micro-purchase threshold" and "simplified acquisition threshold" in \cf3 2.101 \cf4 for the authority to use an increased micro-purchase threshold and simplified acquisition threshold.\

\f0\b 26.202-1 Local area set-aside.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer may set aside solicitations to allow only local firms within a specific geographic area to compete (see \cf3 6.208\cf4 ).\
(a) The contracting officer, in consultation with the requirements office, shall define the specific geographic area for the local set-aside.\
(b) A major disaster or emergency area may span counties in several contiguous States. The set-aside area need not include all the counties in the declared disaster/emergency area(s), but cannot go outside it.\
(c) The contracting officer shall also determine whether a local area set-aside should be further restricted to small business concerns in the set-aside area (see \cf3 part 19\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 26.202-2 Evaluation preference.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer may use an evaluation preference, when authorized in agency regulations or procedures.\

\f0\b 26.203 Transition of work.\

\f1\b0 (a) In anticipation of potential emergency response requirements, agencies involved in response planning should consider awarding emergency response contracts before a major disaster or emergency occurs to ensure immediate response and relief. These contracts should be structured to respond to immediate emergency response needs, and should not be structured in any way that may inhibit the transition of emergency response work to local firms (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , unnecessarily broad scopes of work or long periods of performance).\
(b) \cf3 42U.S.C.5 150(b)(2) \cf4 requires that agencies performing response, relief, and reconstruction activities transition to\
local firms any work performed under contracts in effect on the date on which the President declares a major disaster or emergency, unless the head of such agency determines in writing that it is not feasible or practicable. This determination may be made on an individual contract or class basis. The written determination shall be prepared within a reasonable time given the circumstances of the emergency.\
(c) In effecting the transition, agencies are not required to terminate or renegotiate existing contracts. Agencies should transition the work at the earliest practical opportunity after consideration of the following:\
(1) The potential duration of the disaster or emergency. (2) The severity of the disaster or emergency.\

(5) The expected availability of qualified local offerors who can provide the products or services at a reasonable price. (d) The agency shall transition the work to local firms using the local area set-aside identified in \cf3 26.202-1\cf4 .\

\f0\b 26.204 Justification for expenditures to other than local firms.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 42U.S.C .5150(b)(1) \cf4 requires that, subsequent to any Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency, any expenditure of Federal funds, under an emergency response contract not awarded to a local firm, must be justified in writing in the contract file. The justification should include consideration for the scope of the major disaster or emergency and the immediate requirements or needs of supplies and services to ensure life is protected, victims are cared for, and property is protected.\
(b) The justification may be made on an individual or class basis. The contracting officer approves the justification.\

\f0\b 26.205 Disaster Response Registry.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracting officers shall consult the Disaster Response Registry via \cf3 https://www.sam.gov \cf4 to determine the availability of contractors for debris removal, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other disaster or emergency relief activities inside the United States and outlying areas.\
(b) A list of prospective vendors voluntarily participating in the Disaster Response Registry can be retrieved using the System for Award Management (SAM) search tool, which can be accessed via \cf3 https://www.sam.gov\cf4 , Search Records, Advanced Search, Disaster Response Registry Search.

\fs20 27.101 Applicability.\

\f1\b0 This part applies to all agencies. However, agencies are authorized to adopt alternative policies, procedures, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses to the extent necessary to meet the specific requirements of laws, executive orders, treaties, or international agreements. Any agency adopting alternative policies, procedures, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses should include them in the agency\'92s published regulations.\

\f0\b 27.102 General guidance.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Government encourages the maximum practical commercial use of inventions made under Government contracts.\
(b) Generally, the Government will not refuse to award a contract on the grounds that the prospective contractor may infringe a patent. The Government may authorize and consent to the use of inventions in the performance of certain contracts, even though the inventions may be covered by U.S. patents.\
(c) Generally, contractors providing commercial products and commercial services should indemnify the Government against liability for the infringement of U.S. patents.\
(d) The Government recognizes rights in data developed at private expense, and limits its demands for delivery of that data. When such data is delivered, the Government will acquire only those rights essential to its needs.\
(e) Generally, the Government requires that contractors obtain permission from copyright owners before including copyrighted works, owned by others, in data to be delivered to the Government.\

(a) Patent and copyright infringement liability;\
(b) Royalties;\
(c) Security requirements for patent applications containing classified subject matter; and (d) Patented technology under trade agreements.\

\f0\b 27.201 Patent and copyright infringement liability.\
27.201-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Pursuant to \cf3 28 U.S.C. 1498\cf4 , the exclusive remedy for patent or copyright infringement by or on behalf of the Government is a suit for monetary damages against the Government in the Court of Federal Claims. There is no injunctive relief available, and there is no direct cause of action against a contractor that is infringing a patent or copyright with the authorization or consent of the Government (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , while performing a contract).\
(b) The Government may expressly authorize and consent to a contractor\'92s use or manufacture of inventions covered by U.S. patents by inserting the clause at \cf3 52.227-1\cf4 , Authorization and Consent.\
(c) Because of the exclusive remedies granted in \cf3 28 U.S.C. 1498\cf4 , the Government requires notice and assistance from its contractors regarding any claims for patent or copyright infringement by inserting the clause at \cf3 52.227-2\cf4 , Notice and Assistance, Regarding Patent and Copyright Infringement.\
(d) The Government may require a contractor to reimburse it for liability for patent infringement arising out of a contract for commercial products or commercial services by inserting the clause at \cf3 52.227-3\cf4 , Patent Indemnity.\

\f0\b 27.201-2 Contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-1\cf4 , Authorization and Consent, in solicitations and contracts except that use of the clause is-\
(i) Optional when using simplified acquisition procedures; and\
(ii) Prohibited when both complete performance and delivery are outside the United States.\
(2) Use the clause with its Alternate I in all R&D solicitations and contracts for which the primary purpose is R&D work, except that this alternate shall not be used in construction and architect-engineer contracts unless the contract calls\
exclusively for R&D work.\
(3) Use the clause with its Alternate II in solicitations and contracts for communication services with a common carrier\
and the services are unregulated and not priced by a tariff schedule set by a regulatory body.\
(b) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-2\cf4 , Notice and Assistance Regarding Patent and Copyright Infringement, in all solicitations\
and contracts that include the clause at \cf3 52.227-1\cf4 , Authorization and Consent.\
(c) (1) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-3\cf4 , Patent Indemnity, in solicitations and contracts that may result in the delivery of\
commercial products or the provision of commercial services unless- (i) \cf3 part 12 \cf4 procedures are used;\
(ii) The simplified acquisition procedures of \cf3 part 13 \cf4 are used;\
(iii) Both complete performance and delivery are outside the United States; or\
(iv) The contracting officer determines after consultation with legal counsel that omission of the clause would be\
consistent with commercial practice.\
(2) Use the clause with either its Alternate I (identification of excluded items) or II (identification of included items) if-\
(i) The contract also requires delivery of items that are not commercial products or the provision of services that are not commercial services; or\
(ii) The contracting officer determines after consultation with legal counsel that limitation of applicability of the clause would be consistent with commercial practice.\
(3) Use the clause with its Alternate III if the solicitation or contract is for communication services and facilities where performance is by a common carrier, and the services are unregulated and are not priced by a tariff schedule set by a regulatory body.\

\fs20 (d) (1) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-4\cf4 , Patent Indemnity-Construction Contracts, in solicitations and contracts for construction or that are fixed-price for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements. Do not insert the clause in contracts solely for architect-engineer services.\
(2) If the contracting officer determines that the construction will necessarily involve the use of structures, products, materials, equipment, processes, or methods that are nonstandard, noncommercial, or special, the contracting officer may expressly exclude them from the patent indemnification by using the clause with its Alternate I. Note that this exclusion is for items, as distinguished from identified patents (see paragraph (e) of this subsection).\
(e) It may be in the Government\'92s interest to exempt specific U.S. patents from the patent indemnity clause. Exclusion from indemnity of identified patents, as distinguished from items, is the prerogative of the agency head. Upon written approval of the agency head, the contracting officer may insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-5\cf4 , Waiver of Indemnity, in solicitations and contracts in addition to the appropriate patent indemnity clause.\
(f) If a patent indemnity clause is not prescribed, the contracting officer may include one in the solicitation and contract if it is in the Government\'92s interest to do so.\
(g) The contracting officer shall not include in any solicitation or contract any clause whereby the Government agrees to indemnify a contractor for patent infringement.\

\f0\b 27.202 Royalties.\
27.202-1 Reporting of royalties.\

\f1\b0 (a) To determine whether royalties anticipated or actually paid under Government contracts are excessive, improper,\
or inconsistent with Government patent rights the solicitation provision at \cf3 52.227-6 \cf4 requires prospective contractors to furnish royalty information. The contracting officer shall take appropriate action to reduce or eliminate excessive or improper royalties.\
(b) If the response to a solicitation includes a charge for royalties, the contracting officer shall, before award of the contract, forward the information to the office having cognizance of patent matters for the contracting activity. The cognizant office shall promptly advise the contracting officer of appropriate action.\
(c) The contracting officer, when considering the approval of a subcontract, shall require royalty information if it is required under the prime contract. The contracting officer shall forward the information to the office having cognizance of patent matters. However, the contracting officer need not delay consent while awaiting advice from the cognizant office.\
(d) The contracting officer shall forward any royalty reports to the office having cognizance of patent matters for the contracting activity.\

\f0\b 27.202-2 Notice of Government as a licensee.\

\f1\b0 (a) When the Government is obligated to pay a royalty on a patent because of an existing license agreement and the contracting officer believes that the licensed patent will be applicable to a prospective contract, the Government should furnish the prospective offerors with-\
(1) Notice of the license;\
(2) The number of the patent; and\
(3) The royalty rate cited in the license.\
(b) When the Government is obligated to pay such a royalty, the solicitation should also require offerors to furnish information indicating whether or not each offeror is the patent owner or a licensee under the patent. This information is necessary so that the Government may either-\
(1) Evaluate an offeror\'92s price by adding an amount equal to the royalty; or\
(2) Negotiate a price reduction with an offeror when the offeror is licensed under the same patent at a lower royalty rate.\

\f0\b 27.202-3 Adjustment of royalties.\

\f1\b0 (a) If at any time the contracting officer believes that any royalties paid, or to be paid, under a contract or subcontract are inconsistent with Government rights, excessive, or otherwise improper, the contracting officer shall promptly report the facts to the office having cognizance of patent matters for the contracting activity concerned.\
(b) In coordination with the cognizant office, the contracting officer shall promptly act to protect the Government against payment of royalties-\
(1) With respect to which the Government has a royalty-free license; 27.2-2\

\f1\b0 (2) At a rate in excess of the rate at which the Government is licensed; or\
(3) When the royalties in whole or in part otherwise constitute an improper charge.\
(c) In appropriate cases, the contracting officer in coordination with the cognizant office shall demand a refund pursuant to\
any refund of royalties clause in the contract (see \cf3 27.202-4\cf4 ) or negotiate for a reduction of royalties.\
(d) For guidance in evaluating information furnished pursuant to \cf3 27.202-1\cf4 , see \cf3 31.205-37\cf4 . See also \cf3 31.109 \cf4 regarding\
advance understandings on particular cost items, including royalties.\

\f0\b 27.202-4 Refund of royalties.\

\f1\b0 The clause at \cf3 52.227-9\cf4 , Refund of Royalties, establishes procedures to pay the contractor royalties under the contract and recover royalties not paid by the contractor when the royalties were included in the contractor\'92s fixed price.\

\f0\b 27.202-5 Solicitation provisions and contract clause.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Insert a solicitation provision substantially the same as the provision at \cf3 52.227-6\cf4 , Royalty Information, in-\
(i) Any solicitation that may result in a negotiated contract for which royalty information is desired and for which\
certified cost or pricing data are obtained under \cf3 15.403\cf4 ; or\
(ii) Sealed bid solicitations only if the need for such information is approved at a level above the contracting officer\
as being necessary for proper protection of the Government\'92s interests.\
(2) If the solicitation is for communication services and facilities by a common carrier, use the provision with its\
Alternate I.\
(b) If the Government is obligated to pay a royalty on a patent involved in the prospective contract, insert in the\
solicitation a provision substantially the same as the provision at \cf3 52.227-7\cf4 , Patents-Notice of Government Licensee. If the clause at \cf3 52.227-6 \cf4 is not included in the solicitation, the contracting officer may require offerors to provide information sufficient to provide this notice to the other offerors.\
(c) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-9\cf4 , Refund of Royalties, in negotiated fixed-price solicitations and contracts when royalties may be paid under the contract. If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, change "price" to "target cost and target profit" wherever it appears in the clause. The clause may be used in cost-reimbursement contracts where agency approval of royalties is necessary to protect the Government\'92s interests.\

\f0\b 27.203 Security requirements for patent applications containing classified subject matter.\
27.203-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unauthorized disclosure of classified subject matter, whether in patent applications or resulting from the issuance of a patent, may be a violation of \cf3 18 U.S.C. 792\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq
\f1\i0 . (Chapter 37-Espionage and Censorship), and related statutes, and may be contrary to the interests of national security.\
(b) Upon receipt of a patent application under paragraph (a) or (b) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-10\cf4 , Filing of Patent Applications-Classified Subject Matter, the contracting officer shall ascertain the proper security classification of the patent application. If the application contains classified subject matter, the contracting officer shall inform the contractor how to transmit the application to the United States Patent Office in accordance with procedures provided by legal counsel. If the material is classified "Secret" or higher, the contracting officer shall make every effort to notify the contractor within 30 days of the Government\'92s determination, pursuant to paragraph (a) of the clause.\
(c) Upon receipt of information furnished by the contractor under paragraph (d) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-10\cf4 , the contracting officer shall promptly submit that information to legal counsel in order that the steps necessary to ensure the security of the application will be taken.\
(d) The contracting officer shall act promptly on requests for approval of foreign filing under paragraph (c) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-10 \cf4 in order to avoid the loss of valuable patent rights of the Government or the contractor.\

\f0\b 27.203-2 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-10\cf4 , Filing of Patent Applications-Classified Subject Matter, in all classified solicitations and contracts and in all solicitations and contracts where the nature of the work reasonably might result in a patent application containing classified subject matter.\

\fs24 Subpart 27.3 - Patent Rights under Government Contracts\

\fs20 27.300 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes policies, procedures, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses pertaining to inventions made in the performance of work under a Government contract or subcontract for experimental, developmental, or research work. Agency policies, procedures, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses may be specified in agency supplemental regulations as permitted by law, including 37 CFR 401.1.\

\f0\b 27.301 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Invention 
\f1\i0 means any invention or discovery that is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the U.S. Code, or any variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (\cf3 7 U.S .C. 2321\cf4 , 
\f2\i et seq
\f1\i0 .)\

\f2\i Made 
\f1\i0 means-\
(1) When used in relation to any invention other than a plant variety, means the conception or first actual reduction to\
practice of the invention; or\
(2) When used in relation to a plant variety, means that the contractor has at least tentatively determined that the variety\
has been reproduced with recognized characteristics.\

\f2\i Nonprofit organization 
\f1\i0 means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described\
in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (\cf3 26 U.S.C. 501(c)\cf4 ) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (\cf3 26 U. S.C. 501(a)\cf4 ), or any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a State nonprofit organization statute.\

\f2\i Practical application 
\f1\i0 means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.\

\f2\i Subject invention 
\f1\i0 means any invention of the contractor made in the performance of work under a Government contract.\

\f0\b 27.302 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Introduction
\f1\i0 . In accordance with chapter 18 of title 35, U.S.C. (as implemented by 37 CFR part 401), Presidential Memorandum on Government Patent Policy to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies dated February 18, 1983, and Executive Order 12591, Facilitating Access to Science and Technology dated April 10, 1987, it is the policy and objective of the Government to-\
(1) Use the patent system to promote the use of inventions arising from federally supported research or development; (2) Encourage maximum participation of industry in federally supported research and development efforts;\
(3) Ensure that these inventions are used in a manner to promote free competition and enterprise without unduly\
encumbering future research and discovery;\
(4) Promote the commercialization and public availability of the inventions made in the United States by United States\
industry and labor;\
(5) Ensure that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the\
Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions; and (6) Minimize the costs of administering patent policies.\
(b) 
\f2\i Contractor right to elect title
\f1\i0 . (1) Generally, pursuant to \cf3 35 U.S.C. 202 \cf4 and the Presidential Memorandum and Executive order cited in paragraph (a) of this section, each contractor may, after required disclosure to the Government, elect to retain title to any subject invention.\
(2) A contract may require the contractor to assign to the Government title to any subject invention-\
(i) When the contractor is not located in the United States or does not have a place of business located in the United\
States or is subject to the control of a foreign government (see \cf3 27.303\cf4 (e)(1)(i));\
(ii) In exceptional circumstances, when an agency determines that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title\
in any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of chapter 18 of title 35, U.S.C. and the Presidential Memorandum;\
(iii) When a Government authority, that is authorized by statute or executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, determines that the restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention is necessary to protect the security of such activities;\

\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (iv) When the contract includes the operation of a Government-owned, contractor-operated facility of the Department of Energy (DOE) primarily dedicated to the Department\'92s naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs and all funding agreement limitations under \cf3 35 U. S.C. 202(a)(iv) \cf4 for agreements with small business concerns and nonprofit organizations are limited to inventions occurring under the above two programs; or\
(v) Pursuant to statute or in accordance with agency regulations.\
(3) When the Government has the right to acquire title to a subject invention, the contractor may, nevertheless, request\
greater rights to a subject invention (see \cf3 27.304-1\cf4 (c)).\
(4) Consistent with 37 CFR part 401, when a contract with a small business concern or nonprofit organization requires\
assignment of title to the Government based on the exceptional circumstances enumerated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section for reasons of national security, the contract shall still provide the contractor with the right to elect ownership to any subject invention that-\
(i) Is not classified by the agency; or\
(ii) Is not limited from dissemination by the DOE within 6 months from the date it is reported to the agency. (5) Contracts in support of DOE\'92s naval nuclear propulsion program are exempted from this paragraph (b).\
(6) When a contract involves a series of separate task orders, an agency may structure the contract to apply the\
exceptions at paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section to individual task orders.\
(c) 
\f2\i Government license
\f1\i0 . The Government shall have at least a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up\
license to practice, or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States, any subject invention throughout the world. The Government may require additional rights in order to comply with treaties or other international agreements. In such case, these rights shall be made a part of the contract (see \cf3 27.303\cf4 ).\
(d) Government right to receive title. (1) In addition to the right to obtain title to subject inventions pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, the Government has the right to receive title to an invention-\
(i) If the contractor has not disclosed the invention within the time specified in the clause; or (ii) In any country where the contractor-\
  clause;\
(A) Does not elect to retain rights or fails to elect to retain rights to the invention within the time specified in the\
(B) Has not filed a patent or plant variety protection application within the time specified in the clause;\
(C) Decides not to continue prosecution of a patent or plant variety protection application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on the patent; or\
(D) No longer desires to retain title.\
(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, filing in a European Patent Office Region or under the Patent Cooperation\
Treaty constitutes election in the countries selected in the application(s).\
(e) 
\f2\i Utilization reports
\f1\i0 . The Government has the right to require periodic reporting on how any subject invention is being\
used by the contractor or its licensees or assignees. In accordance with \cf3 35 U. S.C. 202(c)(5) \cf4 and 37 CFR part 401, agencies shall not disclose such utilization reports to persons outside the Government without permission of the contractor. Contractors should mark as confidential/proprietary any utilization report to help prevent inadvertent release outside the Government.\
(f) March-in rights. (1) Pursuant to \cf3 35 U .S.C. 203\cf4 , agencies have certain march-in rights that require the contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If the contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention refuses to grant such a license, the agency can grant the license itself. March-in rights may be exercised only if the agency determines that this action is necessary-\
(i) Because the contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in the field(s) of use;\
(ii) To alleviate health or safety needs that are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their licensees;\
(iii) To meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and these requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or\
(iv) Because the agreement required by paragraph (g) of this section has neither been obtained nor waived, or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of its agreement obtained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.\
(2) The agency shall not exercise its march-in rights unless the contractor has been provided a reasonable time to present facts and show cause why the proposed agency action should not be taken. The agency shall provide the contractor an opportunity to dispute or appeal the proposed action, in accordance with \cf3 27.304-1\cf4 (g).\

\f1\b0 (g) 
\f2\i Preference for United States industry
\f1\i0 . In accordance with \cf3 35 U. S.C. 204\cf4 , no contractor that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee of the contractor shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless that person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for this agreement may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would\
be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.\
(h) Special conditions for nonprofit organizations\'92 preference for small business concerns. (1) Nonprofit organization contractors are expected to use reasonable efforts to attract small business licensees (see paragraph (i)(4) of the clause\
at \cf3 52.227-11\cf4 , Patent Rights-Ownership by the Contractor). What constitutes reasonable efforts to attract small business licensees will vary with the circumstances and the nature, duration, and expense of efforts needed to bring the invention to the market.\
(2) Small business concerns that believe a nonprofit organization is not meeting its obligations under the clause\
may report the matter to the Secretary of Commerce. To the extent deemed appropriate, the Secretary of Commerce will undertake informal investigation of the matter, and may discuss or negotiate with the nonprofit organization ways to improve its efforts to meet its obligations under the clause. However, in no event will the Secretary of Commerce intervene in ongoing negotiations or contractor decisions concerning the licensing of a specific subject invention. These investigations, discussions, and negotiations involving the Secretary of Commerce will be in coordination with other interested agencies, including the Small Business Administration. In the case of a contract for the operation of a Government-owned, contractor- operated research or production facility, the Secretary of Commerce will coordinate with the agency responsible for the facility prior to any discussions or negotiations with the contractor.\
(i) Minimum rights to contractor. (1) When the Government acquires title to a subject invention, the contractor is normally granted a revocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license to that subject invention throughout the world. The contractor\'92s license extends to any of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure of which the contractor is a part and includes the right to grant sublicenses to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time of contract award. The contracting officer shall approve or disapprove, in writing, any contractor request to transfer its licenses. No approval is necessary when the transfer is to the successor of that part of the contractor\'92s business to which the subject invention pertains.\
(2) In response to a third party\'92s proper application for an exclusive license, the contractor\'92s domestic license may\
be revoked or modified to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention. The application shall be submitted in accordance with the applicable provisions in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. The contractor\'92s license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to\
the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified to the extent the contractor, its licensees, or\
its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that country. (See the procedures at \cf3 27.304-1\cf4 (f).)\
(j) 
\f2\i Confidentiality of inventions
\f1\i0 . Publishing information concerning an invention before a patent application is filed on a subject invention may create a bar to a valid patent. To avoid this bar, agencies may withhold information from the public that discloses any invention in which the Government owns or may own a right, title, or interest (including a nonexclusive license) (see \cf3 35 U. S.C. 205 \cf4 and 37 CFR part 401). Agencies may only withhold information concerning inventions for a reasonable time in order for a patent application to be filed. Once filed in any patent office, agencies are not required to release copies of any document that is a part of a patent application for those subject inventions. (See also \cf3 27.305-4\cf4 .)\

\fs20 (3) The contracting officer shall not include a patent rights clause in solicitations or contracts for construction work or architect-engineer services that call for or can be expected to involve only "standard types of construction" "Standard types of construction" are those involving previously developed equipment, methods, and processes and in which the distinctive features include only-\
(i) Variations in size, shape, or capacity of conventional structures; or\
(ii) Purely artistic or aesthetic (as distinguished from functionally significant) architectural configurations and designs of both structural and nonstructural members or groupings, whether or not they qualify for design patent protection.\
(b) (1) Unless an alternative patent rights clause is used in accordance with paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-11\cf4 , Patent Rights-Ownership by the Contractor.\
(2) To the extent the information is not required elsewhere in the contract, and unless otherwise specified by agency supplemental regulations, the contracting officer may modify \cf3 52.227-11\cf4 (e) or otherwise supplement the clause to require the contractor to do one or more of the following:\
(i) Provide periodic (but not more frequently than annually) listings of all subject inventions required to be disclosed during the period covered by the report.\
(ii) Provide a report prior to the closeout of the contract listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none.\
(iii) Provide the filing date, serial number, title, patent number and issue date for any patent application filed on any subject invention in any country or, upon request, copies of any patent application so identified.\
(iv) Furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file when a Government employee is a co-inventor.\
(3) Use the clause with its Alternate I if the Government must grant a foreign government a sublicense in subject inventions pursuant to a specified treaty or executive agreement. The contracting officer may modify Alternate I, if the agency head determines, at contract award, that it would be in the national interest to sublicense foreign governments or international organizations pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement. When necessary to effectuate a treaty or agreement, Alternate I may be appropriately modified.\
(4) Use the clause with its Alternate II in contracts that may be affected by existing or future treaties or agreements.\
(5) Use the clause with its Alternate III in contracts with nonprofit organizations for the operation of a Government- owned facility.\
(6) If the contract is for the operation of a Government-owned facility, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate IV.\

S.C. 3710a\cf4 , the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate V. Since this provision is considered an exercise of an agency\'92s "exceptional circumstances" authority, the contracting officer must comply with 37 CFR 401.3(e) and 401.4.\
(c) Insert a patent rights clause in accordance with the procedures at \cf3 27.304-2 \cf4 if the solicitation or contract is being placed on behalf of another Government agency.\
(d) Insert a patent rights clause in accordance with agency procedures if the solicitation or contract is for DoD, DOE, or NASA, and the contractor is other than a small business concern or nonprofit organization.\
(e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and after compliance with the applicable procedures in \cf3 27.304-1\cf4 (b), the contracting officer may insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-13\cf4 , Patent Rights-Ownership by the Government, or a clause prescribed by agency supplemental regulations, if-\
(i) The contractor is not located in the United States or does not have a place of business located in the United States or is subject to the control of a foreign government;\
(ii) There are exceptional circumstances and the agency head determines that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of chapter 18 of title 35 of the United States Code;\
(iii) A Government authority that is authorized by statute or executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, determines that restriction or elimination of the right to retain any subject invention is necessary to protect the security of such activities; or\

\f0\b 27.304 Procedures.\
27.304-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Status as small business concern or nonprofit organization
\f1\i0 . If an agency has reason to question the size or nonprofit status of the prospective contractor, the agency may require the prospective contractor to furnish evidence of its nonprofit status or may file a size protest in accordance with FAR \cf3 19.302\cf4 .\
(b) Exceptions. (1) Before using any of the exceptions under \cf3 27.303\cf4 (e)(1) in a contract with a small business concern or a nonprofit organization and before using the exception of \cf3 27.303\cf4 (e)(1)(ii) for any contractor, the agency shall follow the applicable procedures at 37 CFR 401.\
(2) A small business concern or nonprofit organization is entitled to an administrative review of the use of the exceptions at \cf3 27.303\cf4 (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv) in accordance with agency procedures and 37 CFR part 401.\
(c) 
\f2\i Greater rights determinations
\f1\i0 . Whenever the contract contains the clause at \cf3 52.227-13\cf4 , Patent Rights-Ownership by the Government, or a patent rights clause modified pursuant to \cf3 27.303\cf4 (e)(2), the contractor (or an employee-inventor of\
the contractor after consultation with the contractor) may request greater rights to an identified invention within the period specified in the clause. The contracting officer may grant requests for greater rights if the contracting officer determines that the interests of the United States and the general public will be better served. In making these determinations, the contracting officer shall consider at least the following objectives (see 37 CFR 401.3(b) and 401.15):\
(1) Promoting the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research and development.\
(2) Ensuring that inventions are used in a manner to promote full and open competition and free enterprise without unduly encumbering future research and discovery.\
(3) Promoting public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States industry and labor.\
(4) Ensuring that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.\
(d) 
\f2\i Retention of rights by inventor
\f1\i0 . If the contractor elects not to retain title to a subject invention, the agency may consider and, after consultation with the contractor, grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor. Retention of rights by the inventor will be subject to the conditions in paragraphs (d) (except paragraph (d)(1)(i)), (e)(4), (f), (g), and (h) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-11\cf4 , Patent Rights-Ownership by the Contractor.\
(e) 
\f2\i Government assignment to contractor of rights in Government employees\'92 inventions
\f1\i0 . When a Government employee is a co-inventor of an invention made under a contract with a small business concern or nonprofit organization, the agency employing the co-inventor may license or assign whatever rights it may acquire in the subject invention from its employee to the contractor, subject at least to the conditions of \cf3 35 U.S. C. 202-204\cf4 .\
(f) 
\f2\i Revocation or modification of contractor\'92s minimum rights
\f1\i0 . Before revoking or modifying the contractor\'92s license in accordance with \cf3 27.302\cf4 (i)(2), the contracting officer shall furnish the contractor a written notice of intention to revoke\

\fs20 or modify the license. The agency shall allow the contractor at least 30 days (or another time as may be authorized for good cause by the contracting officer) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations, any decisions concerning the revocation or modification.\
(g) 
\f2\i Exercise of march-in rights
\f1\i0 . When exercising march-in rights, agencies shall follow the procedures set forth in 37 CFR 401.6.\
(h) 
\f2\i Licenses and assignments under contracts with nonprofit organizations
\f1\i0 . If the contractor is a nonprofit organization, paragraph (i) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-11 \cf4 provides that certain contractor actions require agency approval.\

\f0\b 27.304-2 Contracts placed by or for other Government agencies.\

\f1\b0 The following procedures apply unless an interagency agreement provides otherwise:\
(a) When a Government agency requests another Government agency to award a contract on its behalf, the request should explain any special circumstances surrounding the contract and specify the patent rights clause to be used. The clause should be selected and modified, if necessary, in accordance with the policies and procedures of this subpart. If, however, the request states that a clause of the requesting agency is required (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , because of statutory requirements, a deviation, or exceptional circumstances), the awarding agency shall use that clause rather than those of this subpart.\
(1) If the request states that an agency clause is required and the work to be performed under the contract is not severable and is funded wholly or in part by the requesting agency, then include the requesting agency clause and no other patent rights clause in the contract.\
(2) If the request states that an agency clause is required, and the work to be performed under the contract is severable, then the contracting officer shall assure that the requesting agency clause applies only to that severable portion of the work and that the work for the awarding agency is subject to the appropriate patent rights clause.\
(3) If the request states that a requesting agency clause is not required in any resulting contract, the awarding agency shall use the appropriate patent rights clause, if any.\
(b) Any action requiring an agency determination, report, or deviation involved in the use of the requesting agency\'92s clause is the responsibility of the requesting agency unless the agencies agree otherwise. However, the awarding agency may not alter the requesting agency\'92s clause without prior approval of the requesting agency.\
(c) The requesting agency may require, and provide instructions regarding, the forwarding or handling of any invention disclosures or other reporting requirements of the specified clauses. Normally, the requesting agency is responsible for the administration of any subject inventions. This responsibility shall be established in advance of awarding any contracts.\

\f0\b 27.304-3 Subcontracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) The policies and procedures in this subpart apply to all subcontracts at any tier.\
(b) Whenever a prime contractor or a subcontractor considers including a particular clause in a subcontract to be inappropriate or a subcontractor refuses to accept the clause, the contracting officer, in consultation with counsel, shall resolve the matter.\
(c) It is Government policy that contractors shall not use their ability to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights for themselves in inventions resulting from subcontracts.\

\f0\b 27.304-4 Appeals.\

\f1\b0 (a) The designated agency official shall provide the contractor with a written statement of the basis, including any relevant facts, for taking any of the following actions:\
(1) A refusal to grant an extension to the invention disclosure period under paragraph (c)(4) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-11\cf4 ; (2) A demand for a conveyance of title to the Government under \cf3 27.302\cf4 (d)(1)(i) and (ii);\
(3) A refusal to grant a waiver under \cf3 27.302\cf4 (g), Preference for United States industry; or\
(4) A refusal to approve an assignment under \cf3 27.304-1\cf4 (h).\
(b) Each agency may establish and publish procedures under which any of these actions may be appealed. These appeal procedures should include administrative due process procedures and standards for fact-finding. The resolution of any appeal shall consider both the factual and legal basis for the action and its consistency with the policy and objectives of \cf3 35 U.S.C. 200-206 \cf4 and \cf3 2 10\cf4 .\
(c) To the extent that any of the actions described in paragraph (a) of this section are subject to appeal under the Contract Disputes statute, the procedures under that statute will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b).\

 27.305 Administration of patent rights clauses.\
27.305-1 Goals.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracts having a patent rights clause should be so administered that-\
(1) Inventions are identified, disclosed, and reported as required by the contract, and elections are made;\
(2) The rights of the Government in subject inventions are established;\
(3) When patent protection is appropriate, patent applications are timely filed and prosecuted by contractors or by the\
Government;\
(4) The rights of the Government in filed patent applications are documented by formal instruments such as licenses or\
assignments; and\
(5) Expeditious commercial utilization of subject inventions is achieved.\
(b) If a subject invention is made under a contract funded by more than one agency, at the request of the contractor or on their own initiative, the agencies shall designate one agency as responsible for administration of the rights of the Government in the invention.\

\f0\b 27.305-2 Administration by the Government.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies should establish and maintain appropriate follow-up procedures to protect the Government\'92s interest and to check that subject inventions are identified and disclosed, and when appropriate, patent applications are filed, and that the Government\'92s rights therein are established and protected. Follow-up activities for contracts that include a clause referenced in \cf3 27.304-2 \cf4 should be coordinated with the appropriate agency.\
(b) (1) The contracting officer administering the contract (or other representative specifically designated in the contract for this purpose) is responsible for receiving invention disclosures, reports, confirmatory instruments, notices, requests, and other documents and information submitted by the contractor pursuant to a patent rights clause.\
(i) For other than confirmatory instruments, if the contractor fails to furnish documents or information as called for by the clause within the time required, the contracting officer shall promptly request the contractor to supply the required documents or information. If the failure persists, the contracting officer shall take appropriate action to secure compliance.\
(ii) If the contractor does not furnish confirmatory instruments within 6 months after filing each patent application, or within 6 months after submitting the invention disclosure if the application has been previously filed, the contracting officer shall request the contractor to supply the required documents.\
(2) The contracting officer shall promptly furnish all invention disclosures, reports, confirmatory instruments, notices, requests, and other documents and information relating to patent rights clauses to legal counsel.\
(c) Contracting activities should establish appropriate procedures to detect and correct failures by the contractor to comply with its obligations under the patent rights clauses, such as failures to disclose and report subject inventions, both during and after contract performance. Government effort to review and correct contractor compliance with its patent rights obligations should be directed primarily toward contracts that are more likely to result in subject inventions significant in number or quality. These contracts include contracts of a research, developmental, or experimental nature; contracts of a large dollar amount; and any other contracts when there is reason to believe the contractor may not be complying with its contractual obligations. Other contracts may be reviewed using a spot-check method, as feasible. Appropriate follow-up procedures\
and activities may include the investigation or review of selected contracts or contractors by those qualified in patent and technical matters to detect failures to comply with contract obligations.\
(d) Follow-up activities should include, where appropriate, use of Government patent personnel-\
(1) To interview agency technical personnel to identify novel developments made in contracts;\
(2) To review technical reports submitted by contractors with cognizant agency technical personnel;\
(3) To check the Official Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other sources for patents issued\
to the contractor in fields related to its Government contracts; and\
(4) To have cognizant Government personnel interview contractor personnel regarding work under the contract\
involved, observe the work on site, and inspect laboratory notebooks and other records of the contractor related to work under the contract.\
(e) If a contractor or subcontractor does not have a clear understanding of its obligations under the clause, or its procedures for complying with the clause are deficient, the contracting officer should explain to the contractor its obligations. The withholding of payments provision (if any) of the patent rights clause may be invoked if the contractor fails to meet the obligations required by the patents rights clause. Significant or repeated failures by a contractor to comply with the patent rights obligation in its contracts shall be documented and made a part of the general file (see \cf3 4.801\cf4 (c)(3)).\

\f0\b\fs20 27.305-3 Securing invention rights acquired by the Government.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies are responsible for implementing procedures necessary to protect the Government\'92s interest in subject inventions. When the Government acquires the entire right, title, and interest in an invention by contract, the chain of title from the inventor to the Government shall be clearly established. This is normally accomplished by an assignment either from each inventor to the contractor and from the contractor to the Government, or from the inventor to the Government with the consent of the contractor. When the Government\'92s rights are limited to a license, there should be a confirmatory instrument to that effect.\
(b) Agencies may, by supplemental instructions, develop suitable assignments, licenses, and other papers evidencing any rights of the Government in patents or patents applications. These instruments should be recorded in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (see Executive Order 9424, Establishing in the United States Patent Office a Register of Government Interests in Patents and Applications for Patents, (February 18, 1944).\

\f0\b 27.305-4 Protection of invention disclosures.\

\f1\b0 (a) The Government will, to the extent authorized by \cf3 35 U.S.C. 205\cf4 , withhold from disclosure to the public any invention disclosures reported under the patent rights clauses of \cf3 52.227-11 \cf4 or \cf3 52.227-13 \cf4 for a reasonable time in order for patent applications to be filed. The Government will follow the policy in \cf3 27.302\cf4 (j) regarding protection of confidentiality.\
(b) The Government should also use reasonable efforts to withhold from disclosure to the public for a reasonable\
time other information disclosing a subject invention. This information includes any data delivered pursuant to contract requirements provided that the contractor notifies the agency as to the identity of the data and the subject invention to which it relates at the time of delivery of the data. This notification shall be provided to both the contracting officer and to any patent representative to which the invention is reported, if other than the contracting officer.\
(c) For more information on protection of invention disclosures, also see 37 CFR 401.13.\

\f0\b 27.306 Licensing background patent rights to third parties.\

\f1\b0 (a) A contract with a small business concern or nonprofit organization shall not contain a provision allowing the Government to require the licensing to third parties of inventions owned by the contractor that are not subject inventions unless the agency head has approved and signed a written justification in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The agency head may not delegate this authority and may exercise the authority only if it is determined that the-\
(1) Use of the invention by others is necessary for the practice of a subject invention or for the use of a work object of the contract; and\
(2) Action is necessary to achieve the practical application of the subject invention or work object.\
(b) Any determination will be on the record after an opportunity for a hearing, and the agency shall notify the contractor of\
the determination by certified or registered mail. The notification shall include a statement that the contractor must bring any action for judicial review of the determination within 60 days after the notification.\

\fs24 Subpart 27.4 - Rights in Data and Copyrights\

\fs20 27.400 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart sets forth policies and procedures regarding rights in data and copyrights, and acquisition of data. The policy statement in \cf3 27.402 \cf4 applies to all executive agencies. The remainder of the subpart applies to all executive agencies except the Department of Defense.\

\f0\b 27.401 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this subpart-\

\f2\i Data 
\f1\i0 means recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term includes technical data and computer software. The term does not include information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.\

\f2\i Form, fit, and function data 
\f1\i0 means data relating to items, components, or processes that are sufficient to enable physical and functional interchangeability, and data identifying source, size, configuration, mating and attachment characteristics, functional characteristics, and performance requirements. For computer software it means data identifying source, functional characteristics, and performance requirements, but specifically excludes the source code, algorithms, processes, formulas, and flow charts of the software.\

\f2\i Limited rights 
\f1\i0 means the rights of the Government in limited rights data as set forth in a Limited Rights Notice.\

\f2\i Limited rights data 
\f1\i0 means data, other than computer software, that embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged, to the extent that such data pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense, including minor modifications. (Agencies may, however, adopt the following alternate definition: Limited rights data means data (other than computer software) developed at private expense that embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged (see \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (b)).\

\f2\i Restricted computer software 
\f1\i0 means computer software developed at private expense and that is a trade secret, is commercial or financial and confidential or privileged, or is copyrighted computer software, including minor modifications of the computer software.\

\f2\i Restricted rights 
\f1\i0 means the rights of the Government in restricted computer software as set forth in a Restricted Rights Notice.\

\f2\i Unlimited rights 
\f1\i0 means the rights of the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit others to do so.\

\f0\b 27.402 Policy.\

\f1\b0 (a) To carry out their missions and programs, agencies acquire or obtain access to many kinds of data produced during or used in the performance of their contracts. Agencies require data to-\
(1) Obtain competition among suppliers;\
(2) Fulfill certain responsibilities for disseminating and publishing the results of their activities;\
(3) Ensure appropriate utilization of the results of research, development, and demonstration activities including the\
dissemination of technical information to foster subsequent technological developments; (4) Meet other programmatic and statutory requirements; and\
(5) Meet specialized acquisition needs and ensure logistics support.\
(b) Contractors may have proprietary interests in data. In order to prevent the compromise of these interests, agencies shall protect proprietary data from unauthorized use and disclosure. The protection of such data is also necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to Government programs. In light of these considerations, agencies shall balance the Government\'92s needs and the contractor\'92s legitimate proprietary interests.\

\f0\b 27.403 Data rights-General.\

\f1\b0 All contracts that require data to be produced, furnished, acquired, or used in meeting contract performance requirements, must contain terms that delineate the respective rights and obligations of the Government and the contractor regarding the use, reproduction, and disclosure of that data. Data rights clauses do not specify the type, quantity or quality of data that\
is to be delivered, but only the respective rights of the Government and the contractor regarding the use, disclosure, or reproduction of the data. Accordingly, the contract shall specify the data to be delivered.\

\f0\b\fs20 27.404 Basic rights in data clause.\

\f1\b0 This section describes the operation of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General, and also the use of the provision at \cf3 52.227-15\cf4 , Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software.\

\f0\b 27.404-1 Unlimited rights data.\

\f1\b0 The Government acquires unlimited rights in the following data except for copyrighted works as provided in \cf3 27.404-3\cf4 :\
(a) Data first produced in the performance of a contract (except to the extent the data constitute minor modifications to data that are limited rights data or restricted computer software).\
(b) Form, fit, and function data delivered under contract.\
(c) Data (except as may be included with restricted computer software) that constitute manuals or instructional and training material for installation, operation, or routine maintenance and repair of items, components, or processes delivered or furnished for use under a contract.\
(d) All other data delivered under the contract other than limited rights data or restricted computer software (see \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 27.404-2 Limited rights data and restricted computer software.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . The basic clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General, enables the contractor to protect qualifying limited rights data and restricted computer software by withholding the data from the Government and instead delivering form, fit, and function data.\
(b) 
\f2\i Alternate definition of limited rights data
\f1\i0 . For contracts that do not require the development, use, or delivery of items, components, or processes that are intended to be acquired by or for the Government, an agency may adopt the alternate definition of limited rights data set forth in Alternate I to the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 . The alternate definition does not require that the data pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense; but rather that the data were developed at private expense and embody a trade secret or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.\
(c) Protection of limited rights data specified for delivery. (1) The clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 with its Alternate II enables the Government to require delivery of limited rights data rather than allow the contractor to withhold the data. To obtain delivery, the contract may identify and specify data to be delivered, or the contracting officer may require, by written request during contract performance, the delivery of data that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause. In addition, the contract may specifically identify data that are not to be delivered under Alternate II or which, if delivered, will be delivered with limited rights. The limited rights obtained by the Government are set forth in the Limited Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II. Agencies shall not, without permission of the contractor, use limited rights data for purposes of manufacture or disclose the data outside the Government except as set forth in the Notice. Any disclosure by the Government shall be subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure by the recipient. The following are examples of specific purposes that may be adopted by an agency in its supplement and added to the Limited Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II of the clause:\
(i) Use (except for manufacture) by support service contractors.\
(ii) Evaluation by nongovernment evaluators.\
(iii) Use (except for manufacture) by other contractors participating in the Government\'92s program of which the\
specific contract is a part.\
(iv) Emergency repair or overhaul work.\
(v) Release to a foreign government, or its instrumentalities, if required to serve the interests of the U.S.\
Government, for information or evaluation, or for emergency repair or overhaul work by the foreign government.\
(2) The provision at \cf3 52.227-15\cf4 , Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps\
the contracting officer to determine whether the clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 should be used with its Alternate II. This provision requests that an offeror state whether limited rights data are likely to be delivered. Where limited rights data are expected to be delivered, use Alternate II. Where negotiations are based on an unsolicited proposal, the need for Alternate II of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 should be addressed during negotiations or discussions, and if Alternate II was not included initially it may be added by modification, if needed, during contract performance.\
(3) If data that would otherwise qualify as limited rights data is delivered as a computer database, the data shall be treated as limited rights data, rather than restricted computer software, for the purposes of paragraph (g) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 .\
(d) Protection of restricted computer software specified for delivery. (1) Alternate III of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , enables the Government to require delivery of restricted computer software rather than allow the contractor to withhold such restricted computer software. To obtain delivery of restricted computer software the contracting officer shall-\

\f1\b0 (i) Identify and specify the deliverable computer software in the contract; or\
(ii) Require by written request during contract performance, the delivery of computer software that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause.\
(2) In considering whether to use Alternate III, contracting officers should note that, unlike other data, computer software is also an end item in itself. Thus, the contracting officer shall use Alternate III if delivery of restricted computer software is required to meet agency needs.\
(3) Unless otherwise agreed (see paragraph (d)(4) of this subsection), the restricted rights obtained by the Government are set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(4) (Alternate III). Such restricted computer software will not be used or reproduced by the Government, or disclosed outside the Government, except that the computer software may be-\
(i) Used or copied for use with the computers for which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which the computers may be transferred;\
(ii) Used or copied for use with a backup computer if any computer for which it was acquired is inoperative; (iii) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;\
(iv) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, 
\f2\i provided 
\f1\i0 that the modified, adapted, or\
combined portions of the derivative software incorporating any of the delivered, restricted computer software shall be subject to the same restricted rights;\
(v) Disclosed to and reproduced for use by support service contractors or their subcontractors, in accordance with paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section; and\
(vi) Used or copied for use with a replacement computer.\
(4) The restricted rights set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection are the minimum rights the Government\
normally obtains with restricted computer software and will automatically apply when such software is acquired under the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 . However, the contracting officer\
may specify different rights in the contract, consistent with the purposes and needs for which the software is to be acquired. For example, the contracting officer should consider any networking needs or any requirements for use of the computer software from remote terminals. Also, in addressing such needs, the scope of the restricted rights may be different for the documentation accompanying the computer software than for the programs and databases. Any additions to, or limitations on, the restricted rights set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 shall be expressly stated in the contract or in a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract, and the notice modified accordingly.\
(5) The provision at \cf3 52.227-15\cf4 , Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps\
the contracting officer determine whether to use the clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 with its Alternate III. This provision requests that\
an offeror state whether restricted computer software is likely to be delivered under the contract. In addition, the need for Alternate III should be addressed during negotiations or discussions with an offeror, particularly where negotiations are based on an unsolicited proposal. However, if Alternate III is not used initially, it may be added by modification, if needed, during contract performance.\

\f0\b 27.404-3 Copyrighted works.\

\f1\b0 (a) Data first produced in the performance of a contract. (1) Generally, the contractor must obtain permission of the contracting officer prior to asserting rights in any copyrighted work containing data first produced in the performance of a contract. However, contractors are normally authorized, without prior approval of the contracting officer, to assert copyright in technical or scientific articles based on or containing such data that is published in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings and similar works.\
(2) The contractor must make a written request for permission to assert its copyright in works containing data first produced under the contract. In its request, the contractor should identify the data involved or furnish copies of the data for which permission is requested, as well as a statement as to the intended publication or dissemination media or other purpose for which the permission is requested. Generally, a contracting officer should grant the contractor\'92s request when copyright protection will enhance the appropriate dissemination or use of the data unless the-\
(i) Data consist of a report that represents the official views of the agency or that the agency is required by statute to prepare;\
(ii) Data are intended primarily for internal use by the Government;\
(iii) Data are of the type that the agency itself distributes to the public under an agency program; (iv) Government determines that limitation on distribution of the data is in the national interest; or\

\fs20 (v) Government determines that the data should be disseminated without restriction.\
(3) Alternate IV of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 provides a substitute paragraph (c)(1) granting permission for contractors\
to assert copyright in any data first produced in the performance of the contract without the need for any further requests. Except for contracts for management or operation of Government facilities and contracts and subcontracts in support of programs being conducted at those facilities or where international agreements require otherwise, Alternate IV shall be used in all contracts for basic or applied research to be performed solely by colleges and universities. Alternate IV shall not be used in contracts with colleges and universities if a purpose of the contract is for development of computer software for distribution to the public (including use in solicitations) by or on behalf of the Government. In addition, Alternate IV may be used in other contracts if an agency determines that it is not necessary for a contractor to request further permission to assert copyright in data first produced in performance of the contract. The contracting officer may exclude any data, or items or categories of data, from the provisions of Alternate IV by expressly so providing in the contract or by adding a paragraph (d) (4) to the clause, consistent with \cf3 27.404-4\cf4 (b).\
(4) Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , the contractor grants the Government a paid-up nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute to the public, perform publicly and display publicly by or on behalf of the Government, for all data (other than computer software) first produced in the performance of a contract. For computer software, the scope of the Government\'92s license includes all of the above rights except the right to distribute to the public. Agencies may also obtain a license of different scope if the contracting officer determines, after consulting with legal counsel, such a license will substantially enhance the dissemination of any data first produced under the contract or if such a license is required to comply with international agreements. If an agency obtains a different license, the contractor shall clearly state the scope of that license in a conspicuous place on the medium on which the data is recorded. For example, if the data is delivered as a report, the terms of the license shall be stated on the cover, or first page, of the report.\
(5) The clause requires the contractor to affix the applicable copyright notices of \cf3 17 U.S .C. 401 \cf4 or \cf3 4 02\cf4 , and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship, (including the contract number) to data when it asserts copyright in data. Failure to do so could result in such data being treated as unlimited rights data (see \cf3 27.404-5\cf4 (b)).\
(b) Data not first produced in the performance of a contract. (1) Contractors shall not deliver any data that is not first produced under the contract without either-\
(i) Acquiring for or granting to the Government a copyright license for the data; or\
(ii) Obtaining permission from the contracting officer to do otherwise.\
(2) The copyright license the Government acquires for such data will normally be of the same scope as discussed in\
paragraph (a)(4) of this subsection, and is set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 . However, agencies may obtain a license of different scope if the agency determines, after consultation with its legal counsel, that such different license will not be inconsistent with the purpose of acquiring the data. If a license of a different scope is acquired, it must\
be so stated in the contract and clearly set forth in a conspicuous place on the data when delivered to the Government. If the contractor delivers computer software not first produced under the contract, the contractor shall grant the Government the license set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III if included in the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , or a license agreed to in a collateral agreement made part of the contract.\

\f0\b 27.404-4 Contractor\'92s release, publication, and use of data.\

\f1\b0 (a) In contracts for basic or applied research with universities or colleges, agencies shall not place any restrictions on\
the conduct of or reporting on the results of unclassified basic or applied research, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. However, agencies may restrict the release or disclosure of computer software that is or is intended to be developed to the point of practical application (including for agency distribution under established programs). This is not considered\
a restriction on the reporting of the results of basic or applied research. Agencies may also preclude a contractor from asserting copyright in any computer software for purposes of established agency distribution programs, or where required to accomplish the purpose for which the software is acquired.\
(b) Except for the results of basic or applied research under contracts with universities or colleges, agencies may, to the extent provided in their FAR supplements, place limitations or restrictions on the contractor\'92s exercise of its rights in data first produced in the performance of the contract, including a requirement to assign copyright to the Government or another party. Any of these restrictions shall be expressly included in the contract.\

 27.404-5 Unauthorized, omitted, or incorrect markings.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unauthorized marking of data. (1) The Government has, in accordance with paragraph (e) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , the right to either return data containing unauthorized markings or to cancel or ignore the markings.\
(2) Agencies shall not cancel or ignore markings without making written inquiry of the contractor and affording the contractor at least 60 days to provide a written justification substantiating the propriety of the markings.\
(i) If the contractor fails to respond or fails to provide a written justification substantiating the propriety of the markings within the time afforded, the Government may cancel or ignore the markings.\
(ii) If the contractor provides a written justification substantiating the propriety of the markings, the contracting officer shall consider the justification.\
(A) If the contracting officer determines that the markings are authorized, the contractor will be so notified in writing.\
(B) If the contracting officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the contractor will be furnished a written determination which becomes the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings and the markings will be cancelled or ignored and the data will no longer be made subject to disclosure prohibitions, unless the contractor files suit within 90 days in a court of competent jurisdiction. The markings will not be cancelled or ignored until final resolution of the matter, either by the contracting officer's determination becoming the final agency decision or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.\
(3) The foregoing procedures may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom\
of Information Act (\cf3 5 U. S.C. 552\cf4 ) if necessary to respond to a request. In addition, the contractor may bring a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of the contract, that may arise as the result of the Government\'92s action to remove or ignore any markings on data, unless the action occurs as the result of a final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction.\
(b) Omitted or incorrect notices. (1) Data delivered under a contract containing the clause without a limited rights notice or restricted rights notice, and without a copyright notice, will be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights, and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of the data. However, to the extent the data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the contractor may, within 6 months (or a longer period approved by the contracting officer for good cause shown), request permission of the contracting officer to have the omitted limited rights or restricted rights notices, as applicable, placed on qualifying data at the contractor's expense. The contracting officer may permit adding appropriate notices if the contractor-\
(i) Identifies the data for which a notice is to be added;\
(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the proposed notice was inadvertent;\
(iii) Establishes that use of the proposed notice is authorized; and\
(iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure or use of any such data made\
prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice. (2) The contracting officer may also-\
(i) Permit correction, at the contractor\'92s expense, of incorrect notices if the contractor identifies the data on which correction of the notice is to be made, and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or\
(ii) Correct any incorrect notices.\

\f0\b 27.404-6 Inspection of data at the contractor\'92s facility.\

\f1\b0 Contracting officers may obtain the right to inspect data at the contractor\'92s facility by use of the clause at \cf3 52.227-14 \cf4 with its Alternate V, which adds paragraph (j) to provide that right. Agencies may also adopt Alternate V for general use. The data subject to inspection may be data withheld or withholdable under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause. Inspection may be made\
by the contracting officer or designee (including nongovernmental personnel under the same conditions as the contracting officer) for the purpose of verifying a contractor\'92s assertion regarding the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data, or for evaluating work performance under the contract. This right may be exercised up to 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under the contract. The contract may specify data items that are not subject to inspection under paragraph (j) of the Alternate. If the contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if inspection were made by a particular representative, the contracting officer shall designate an alternate representative.\

\f0\b\fs20 27.405 Other data rights provisions.\
27.405-1 Special works.\

\f1\b0 (a) The clause at \cf3 52.227-17\cf4 , Rights in Data-Special Works, is for use in contracts (or may be made applicable to portions thereof) that are primarily for the production or compilation of data (other than limited rights data or restricted computer software) for the Government\'92s own use, or when there is a specific need to limit distribution and use of the data or to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, or disclosure of the data. Examples are contracts for-\
(1) The production of audiovisual works, including motion pictures or television recordings with or without accompanying sound, or for the preparation of motion picture scripts, musical compositions, sound tracks, translation, adaptation, and the like;\
(2) Histories of the respective agencies, departments, services, or units thereof;\
(3) Surveys of Government establishments;\
(4) Works pertaining to the instruction or guidance of Government officers and employees in the discharge of their\
official duties;\
(5) The compilation of reports, books, studies, surveys, or similar documents that do not involve research,\
development, or experimental work;\
(6) The collection of data containing personally identifiable information such that the disclosure thereof would violate\
the right of privacy or publicity of the individual to whom the information relates;\
(7) Investigatory reports;\
(8) The development, accumulation, or compilation of data (other than that resulting from research, development, or\
experimental work performed by the contractor), the early release of which could prejudice follow-on acquisition activities or agency regulatory or enforcement activities; or\
(9) The development of computer software programs, where the program-\
(i) May give a commercial advantage; or\
(ii) Is agency mission sensitive, and release could prejudice agency mission, programs, or follow-on acquisitions.\
(b) The contract may specify the purposes and conditions (including time limitations) under which the data may be used, released, or reproduced other than for contract performance. Contracts for the production of audiovisual works, sound recordings, etc., may include limitations in connection with talent releases, music licenses, and the like that are consistent with the purposes for which the works are acquired.\
(c) Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the clause, which enables the Government to obtain assignment of copyright in any data first produced in the performance of the contract, may be deleted if the contracting officer determines that such assignment is not needed to further the objectives of the contract.\
(d) Paragraph (e) of the clause, which requires the contractor to indemnify the Government against any liability incurred as the result of any violation of trade secrets, copyrights, right of privacy or publicity, or any libelous or other unlawful matter arising out of or contained in any production or compilation of data that are subject to the clause, may be deleted or limited in scope where the contracting officer determines that, because of the nature of the particular data involved, such liability will not arise.\
(e) When the audiovisual or other special works are produced to accomplish a public purpose other than acquisition for the Government\'92s own use (such as for production and distribution to the public of the works by other than a Federal agency) agencies are authorized to modify the clause for use in contracts, with rights in data provisions that meet agency mission needs yet protect free speech and freedom of expression, as well as the artistic license of the creator of the work.\

\f0\b 27.405-2 Existing works.\

\f1\b0 The clause at \cf3 52.227-18\cf4 , Rights in Data-Existing Works, is for use in contracts exclusively for the acquisition (without modification) of existing works such as, motion pictures, television recordings, and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and works of a similar nature. The contract may set forth limitations consistent with the purposes for which the works covered by the contract are being acquired. Examples of these limitations are means of exhibition or transmission, time, type of audience, and geographical location. However, if the contract requires that works of the type indicated in this paragraph are to be modified through editing, translation, or addition of subject matter, etc. (rather than purchased in existing form), then see \cf3 27.405-1\cf4 .\

 27.405-3 Commercial computer software.\

\f1\b0 (a) When contracting other than from GSA\'92s Multiple Award Schedule contracts for the acquisition of commercial computer software, no specific contract clause prescribed in this subpart need be used, but the contract shall specifically address the Government\'92s rights to use, disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce the software. Section \cf3 12.212 \cf4 sets forth the guidance for the acquisition of commercial computer software and states that commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation shall be acquired under licenses customarily provided to the public to the extent the\
license is consistent with Federal law and otherwise satisfies the Government\'92s needs. The clause at \cf3 52.227-19\cf4 , Commercial Computer Software License, may be used when there is any confusion as to whether the Government\'92s needs are satisfied or whether a customary commercial license is consistent with Federal law. Additional or lesser rights may be negotiated using the guidance concerning restricted rights as set forth in \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (d), or the clause at \cf3 52.227-19\cf4 . If greater rights than the minimum rights identified in the clause at \cf3 52.227-19 \cf4 are needed, or lesser rights are to be acquired, they shall be negotiated and set forth in the contract. This includes any additions to, or limitations on, the rights set forth in paragraph (b) of the clause at \cf3 52.227-19 \cf4 when used. Examples of greater rights may be those necessary for networking purposes or use of the software from remote terminals communicating with a host computer where the software is located. If the computer software is to be acquired with unlimited rights, the contract shall also so state. In addition, the contract shall adequately describe the computer programs and/or databases, the media on which it is recorded, and all the necessary documentation.\
(b) If the contract incorporates, makes reference to, or uses a vendor\'92s standard commercial lease, license, or purchase agreement, the contracting officer shall ensure that the agreement is consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection.\
The contracting officer should exercise caution in accepting a vendor\'92s terms and conditions, since they may be directed to commercial sales and may not be appropriate for Government contracts. Any inconsistencies in a vendor\'92s standard commercial agreement shall be addressed in the contract and the contract terms shall take precedence over the vendor\'92s standard commercial agreement. If the clause at \cf3 52.227-19 \cf4 is used, inconsistencies in the vendor\'92s standard commercial agreement regarding the Government\'92s right to use, reproduce or disclose the computer software are reconciled by that clause.\
(c) If a prime contractor under a contract containing the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General, with paragraph (g)(4) (Alternate III) in the clause, acquires restricted computer software from a subcontractor (at any tier) as a separate acquisition for delivery to or for use on behalf of the Government, the contracting officer may approve any additions to, or limitations\
on the restricted rights in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) in a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract.\

\f0\b 27.405-4 Other existing data.\

\f1\b0 (a) Except for existing works pursuant to \cf3 27.405-2 \cf4 or commercial computer software pursuant to \cf3 27.405-3\cf4 , no clause contained in this subpart is required to be included in-\
(1) Contracts solely for the acquisition of books, periodicals, and other printed items in the exact form in which these items are to be obtained unless reproduction rights are to be acquired; or\
(2) Other contracts that require only existing data (other than limited rights data) to be delivered and the data are available without disclosure prohibitions, unless reproduction rights to the data are to be obtained.\
(b) If the reproduction rights to the data are to be obtained in any contract of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, the rights shall be specifically set forth in the contract. No clause contained in this subpart is required to be included in contracts substantially for on-line data base services in the same form as they are normally available to the general public.\

\f0\b 27.406 Acquisition of data.\
27.406-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) It is the Government\'92s practice to determine, to the extent feasible, its data requirements in time for inclusion\
in solicitations. The data requirements may be subject to revision during contract negotiations. Since the preparation, reformatting, maintenance and updating, cataloging, and storage of data represents an expense to both the Government and the contractor, efforts should be made to keep the contract data requirements to a minimum, consistent with the purposes of the contract.\
(b) The contracting officer shall specify in the contract all known data requirements, including the time and place for delivery and any limitations and restrictions to be imposed on the contractor in the handling of the data. Further, and to the extent feasible, in major system acquisitions, the contracting officer shall set out data requirements as separate line items.\

\fs20 In establishing the contract data requirements and in specifying data items to be delivered by a contractor, agencies may, consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection, develop their own contract schedule provisions. Agency procedures may, among other things, provide for listing, specifying, identifying source, assuring delivery, and handling any data required to be delivered, first produced, or specifically used in the performance of the contract.\
(c) Data delivery requirements should normally not require that a contractor provide the Government, as a condition of the procurement, unlimited rights in data that qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software. Rather, form, fit, and function data may be furnished with unlimited rights instead of the qualifying data, or the qualifying data may be furnished with limited rights or restricted rights if needed (see \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (c) and (d)). If greater rights are needed, they should be clearly set forth in the solicitation and the contractor fairly compensated for the greater rights.\

\f0\b 27.406-2 Additional data requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) In some contracting situations, such as experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration contracts, it may not be feasible to ascertain all the data requirements at contract award. The clause at \cf3 52.227-16\cf4 , Additional Data Requirements, may be used to enable the subsequent ordering by the contracting officer of additional data first produced or specifically used in the performance of these contracts as the actual requirements become known. The clause shall normally be used\
in solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research or demonstration work (other than basic\
or applied research to be performed under a contract solely by a university or college when the contract amount will be $500,000 or less) unless all the requirements for data are believed to be known at the time of contracting and specified in the contract. If the contract is for basic or applied research to be performed by a university or college, and the contracting officer believes the contract effort will in the future exceed $500,000, even though the initial award does not, the contracting officer may include the clause in the initial award.\
(b) Data may be ordered under the clause at \cf3 52.227-16 \cf4 at any time during contract performance or within a period of 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under the contract. The contractor is to be compensated for converting\
the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, and for delivery. In order to minimize storage costs for the retention of data, the contracting officer may relieve the contractor of the retention requirements for specified data items at any time during the retention period required by the clause. The contracting officer may permit the contractor to identify and specify in the contract data not to be ordered for delivery under the clause if the data is not necessary to meet the Government\'92s requirements for data. Also, the contracting officer may alter the clause by deleting the term "or specifically used" in paragraph (a) of the clause if delivery of the data is not necessary to meet the Government\'92s requirements for data. Any\
data ordered under this clause will be subject to the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General, (or other equivalent clause setting forth the respective rights of the Government and the contractor) in the contract. Data authorized to be withheld under such clause will not be required to be delivered under the clause at \cf3 52.227-16\cf4 , except as provided in Alternate II or Alternate III, if included (see \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (c) and (d)).\
(c) Absent an established program for dissemination of computer software, agencies should not order additional computer software under the clause at \cf3 52.227-16\cf4 , for the sole purpose of disseminating or marketing the software to the public. In ordering software for internal purposes, the contracting officer shall consider, consistent with the Government\'92s needs, not ordering particular source codes, algorithms, processes, formulas, or flow charts of the software if the contractor shows that this aids its efforts to disseminate or market the software.\

\f0\b 27.406-3 Major system acquisition.\

\f1\b0 (a) The clause at \cf3 52.227-21\cf4 , Technical Data Declaration, Revision, and Withholding of Payment-Major Systems, implements \cf3 41 U. S.C. 2302(e)\cf4 . When using the clause at \cf3 52.227-21\cf4 , the section of the contract specifying data delivery requirements (see \cf3 27.406-1\cf4 (b)) shall expressly identify those line items of technical data to which the clause applies. Upon delivery of the technical data, the contracting officer shall review the technical data and the contractor\'92s declaration relating to it to assure that the data are complete, accurate, and comply with contract requirements. If the data are not complete, accurate, or compliant, the contracting officer should request the contractor to correct the deficiencies, and may withhold payment. Final payment shall not be made under the contract until it has been determined that the delivery requirements of those line items of data to which the clause applies have been satisfactorily met.\
(b) In a contract for, or in support of, a major system awarded by a civilian agency other than NASA or the U.S. Coast Guard, the following applies:\
(1) The contracting officer shall require the delivery of any technical data relating to the major system or supplies for the major system, that are to be developed exclusively with Federal funds if the delivery of the technical data is needed to ensure the competitive acquisition of supplies or services that will be required in substantial quantities in the future.\

\f1\b0 The clause at \cf3 52.227-22\cf4 , Major System-Minimum Rights, is used in addition to the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data- General, and other required clauses, to ensure that the Government acquires at least those rights required by Pub. L. 98-577 in technical data developed exclusively with Federal funds.\
(2) Technical data, relating to a major system or supplies for a major system, procured or to be procured by the Government and also relating to the design, development, or manufacture of products or processes offered or to be offered for sale to the public (except for such data as may be necessary for the Government to operate or maintain the product, or use the process if obtained by the Government as an element of performance under the contract), shall not be required to be provided to the Government from persons who have developed such products or processes as a condition for the procurement of such products or processes by the Government.\

\f0\b 27.407 Rights to technical data in successful proposals.\

\f1\b0 The clause at \cf3 52.227-23\cf4 , Rights to Proposal Data (Technical), allows the Government to acquire unlimited rights to technical data in successful proposals. Pursuant to the clause, the prospective contractor is afforded the opportunity to specifically identify pages containing technical data to be excluded from the grant of unlimited rights. This exclusion is not dispositive of the protective status of the data, but any excluded technical data, as well as any commercial and financial information contained in the proposal, will remain subject to the policies in \cf3 subpart 15.2 \cf4 or \cf3 15.6 \cf4 (or agency supplements) relating to proposal information (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , will be used for evaluation purposes only). If there is a need to have access to any of the excluded technical data during contract performance, consideration should be given to acquiring the data with limited rights, if they so qualify, in accordance with \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (c).\

\f0\b 27.408 Cosponsored research and development activities.\

\f1\b0 (a) In contracts involving cosponsored research and development that require the contractor to make substantial contributions of funds or resources (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , by cost-sharing or by repayment of nonrecurring costs), and the contractor\'92s and the Government\'92s respective contributions to any item, component, process, or computer software, developed or produced under the contract are not readily segregable, the contracting officer may limit the acquisition of, or acquire less than unlimited rights to, any data developed and delivered under the contract. Agencies may regulate the use of this authority in their supplements. Lesser rights shall, at a minimum, assure use of the data for agreed-to Governmental purposes (including reprocurement rights as appropriate), and address any disclosure limitations or restrictions to be imposed on the data. Also, consideration may be given to requiring the contractor to directly license others if needed to carry out the objectives of\
the contract. Since the purpose of the cosponsored research and development, the legitimate proprietary interests of the contractor, the needs of the Government, and the respective contributions of both parties may vary, no specific clauses are prescribed, but a clause providing less than unlimited rights in the Government for data developed and delivered under the contract (such as license rights) may be tailored to the circumstances consistent with the foregoing and the policy set forth\
in \cf3 27.402\cf4 . As a guide, a clause may be appropriate when the contractor contributes money or resources, or agrees to make repayment of nonrecurring costs, of a value of approximately 50 percent of the total cost of the contract (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , Government, contractor, and/or third party paid costs), and the respective contributions are not readily segregable for any work element\
to be performed under the contract. A clause may be used for all or for only specifically identified tasks or work elements under the contract. In the latter instance, its use will be in addition to whatever other data rights clause is prescribed under this subpart, with the contract specifically identifying which clause is to apply to which tasks or work elements. Further, this type of clause may not be appropriate where the purpose of the contract is to produce data for dissemination to the public, or to develop or demonstrate technologies that will be available, in any event, to the public for its direct use.\
(b) Where the contractor\'92s contributions are readily segregable (by performance requirements and the funding for the contract) and so identified in the contract, any resulting data may be treated under this clause as limited rights data or restricted computer software in accordance with \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (c) or (d), as applicable; or if this treatment is inconsistent with the purpose of the contract, rights to the data may, if so negotiated and stated in the contract, be treated in a manner consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.\

\f0\b 27.409 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\

\f1\b0 (a) Generally, a contract should contain only one data rights clause. However, where more than one is needed, the contract should distinguish the portion of contract performance to which each pertains.\
(b) (1) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General, in solicitations and contracts if it is contemplated that data will be produced, furnished, or acquired under the contract, unless the contract is-\

\fs20 (i) For the production of special works of the type set forth in \cf3 27.405-1\cf4 , although in these cases insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General, and make it applicable to data other than special works, as appropriate (see paragraph (e) of this section);\
(ii) For the acquisition of existing data, commercial computer software, or other existing data, as described in \cf3 27.405-2 \cf4 through \cf3 27.405-4 \cf4 (see paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section);\
(iii) A small business innovation research contract (see paragraph (h) of this section);\
(iv) To be performed outside the United States (see paragraph (i)(1) of this section);\
(v) For architect-engineer services or construction work (see paragraph (i)(2) of this section);\
(vi) For the management, operation, design, or construction of a Government-owned facility to perform research,\
development, or production work (see paragraph (i)(3) of this section); or\
(vii) A contract involving cosponsored research and development in which a clause providing for less than unlimited\
right has been authorized (see \cf3 27.408\cf4 ).\
(2) If an agency determines, in accordance with \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (b), to adopt the alternate definition of "Limited Rights Data"\
in paragraph (a) of the clause, use the clause with its Alternate I.\
(3) If a contracting officer determines, in accordance with \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (c) that it is necessary to obtain limited rights data,\
use the clause with its Alternate II. The contracting officer shall complete paragraph (g)(3) to include the purposes, if any, for which limited rights data are to be disclosed outside the Government.\
(4) In accordance with \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (d), if a contracting officer determines it is necessary to obtain restricted computer software, use the clause with its Alternate III. Any greater or lesser rights regarding the use, reproduction, or disclosure of restricted computer software than those set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of the clause shall be specified in the contract and the notice modified accordingly.\
(5) Use the clause with its Alternate IV in contracts for basic or applied research (other than those for the management or operation of Government facilities, and contracts and subcontracts in support of programs being conducted at those facilities or where international agreements require otherwise) to be performed solely by universities and colleges. The clause may be used with its Alternate IV in other contracts if in accordance with \cf3 27.404-3\cf4 (a), an agency determines to grant permission for the contractor to assert claim to copyright subsisting in all data first produced without further request being made by the contractor. When Alternate IV is used, the contract may exclude items or categories of data from the permission granted, either by express provisions in the contract or by the addition of a paragraph (d)(4) to the clause (see \cf3 27.404-4\cf4 ).\
(6) In accordance with \cf3 27.404-6\cf4 , if the Government needs the right to inspect certain data at a contractor\'92s facility, use the clause with its Alternate V.\
(c) In accordance with \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (c)(2) and \cf3 27.404-2\cf4 (d)(5), if the contracting officer desires to have an offeror state in response to a solicitation whether limited rights data or restricted computer software are likely to be used in meeting the\
data delivery requirements set forth in the solicitation, insert the provision at \cf3 52.227-15\cf4 , Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, in any solicitation containing the clause at \cf3 52.227-14\cf4 , Rights in Data-General. The contractor\'92s response may provide an aid in determining whether the clause should be used with Alternate II and/or Alternate III.\
(d) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-16\cf4 , Additional Data Requirements, in solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed solely by a university or college where the contract amount will be $500,000 or less) unless all the requirements for data are believed to be known at the time of contracting and specified in the contract (see \cf3 27.406-2\cf4 ). This clause may also be used in other contracts when considered appropriate. For example, if the contract is for basic or applied research to be performed by a university or college, and the contracting officer believes the contract effort will in the future exceed $500,000, even though the initial award does not, the contracting officer may include the clause in the initial award.\
(e) In accordance with \cf3 27.405-1\cf4 , insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-17\cf4 , Rights in Data-Special Works, in solicitations and contracts primarily for the production or compilation of data (other than limited rights data or restricted computer software) for the Government\'92s internal use, or when there is a specific need to limit distribution and use of the data or to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, or disclosure of the data. Examples of such contracts are set forth in \cf3 27.405-1\cf4 .\
(1) Insert the clause if existing works are to be modified, as by editing, translation, addition of subject matter, etc.\
(2) The contract may specify the purposes and conditions (including time limitations) under which the data may be used, released, or reproduced by the contractor for other than contract performance.\
(3) Contracts for the production of audiovisual works, sound recordings, etc. may include limitations in connection with talent releases, music licenses, and the like that are consistent with the purposes for which the data is acquired.\

(f) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-18\cf4 , Rights in Data-Existing Works, in solicitations and contracts exclusively for the\
acquisition, without modification, of existing audiovisual and similar works of the type set forth in \cf3 27.405-2\cf4 . The contract may set forth limitations consistent with the purposes for which the work is being acquired. While no specific clause of\
this subpart is required to be included in contracts solely for the acquisition, without disclosure prohibitions, of books, publications, and similar items in the exact form in which the items exist prior to the request for purchase (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , the off-the- shelf purchase of such items), or in other contracts where only existing data available without disclosure prohibitions is to be furnished, if reproduction rights are to be acquired, the contract shall include terms addressing such rights. (See \cf3 27.405-4\cf4 .)\
(g) In accordance with \cf3 27.405-3\cf4 , when contracting (other than from GSA\'92s Multiple Award Schedule contracts) for\
the acquisition of commercial computer software, the contracting officer may insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-19\cf4 , Commercial Computer Software License, in the solicitation and contract. In any event, the contracting officer shall assure that the contract contains terms to obtain sufficient rights for the Government to fulfill the need for which the software is being acquired and is otherwise consistent with \cf3 27.405-3\cf4 .\
(h) If the contract is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-20\cf4 , Rights in Data-SBIR Program in all Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III contracts awarded under the Small Business Innovation Research Program established pursuant to \cf3 15 U. S.C. 638\cf4 . The SBIR protection period may be extended in accordance with the Small Business Administration\'92s "Small Business Innovation Research Program Policy Directive" (September24,2002).\
(i) Agencies may prescribe in their procedures, as appropriate, a clause consistent with the policy of \cf3 27.402 \cf4 in contracts- (1) To be performed outside the United States;\

or\
(3) For management, operation, design, or construction of Government-owned research, development, or production\
facilities, and in contracts and subcontracts in support of programs being conducted at such facilities.\

of Payment-Major Systems, in contracts for major systems acquisitions or for support of major systems acquisitions. This requirement includes contracts for detailed design, development, or production of a major system and contracts for any individual part, component, subassembly, assembly, or subsystem integral to the major system, and other property that may be replaced during the service life of the system, including spare parts. When used, this clause requires that the technical data to which it applies be specified in the contract (see \cf3 27.406-3\cf4 (a)).\
(k) In accordance with \cf3 27.406-3\cf4 (b), in the case of civilian agencies other than NASA and the U.S. Coast Guard, insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-22\cf4 , Major System-Minimum Rights, in contracts for major systems or contracts in support of major systems.\
(l) In accordance with \cf3 27.407\cf4 , if a contracting officer desires to acquire unlimited rights in technical data contained in a successful proposal upon which a contract award is based, insert the clause at \cf3 52.227-23\cf4 , Rights to Proposal Data (Technical). Rights to technical data in a proposal are not acquired by mere incorporation by reference of the proposal in the contract, and if a proposal is incorporated by reference, the contracting officer shall follow \cf3 27.404 \cf4 to assure that the rights are appropriately addressed.\

 28.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part prescribes requirements for obtaining financial protection against losses under contracts that result from the use of the sealed bid or negotiated methods. It covers bid guarantees, bonds, alternative payment protections, security for bonds, and insurance.\

\f0\b 28.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Attorney-in-fact 
\f1\i0 means an agent, independent agent, underwriter, or any other company or individual holding a power of attorney granted by a surety (see also "power of attorney" at \cf3 2.101\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Bid 
\f1\i0 means any response to a solicitation, including a proposal under a negotiated acquisition. See the definition of "offer" at \cf3 2.101\cf4 .\

\f2\i Bid guarantee 
\f1\i0 means a form of security assuring that the bidder-\
(1) Will not withdraw a bid within the period specified for acceptance; and\
(2) Will execute a written contract and furnish required bonds, including any necessary coinsurance or reinsurance\
agreements, within the time specified in the bid, unless a longer time allowed, after receipt of the specified forms. 
\f2\i Bidder 
\f1\i0 means any entity that is responding or has responded to a solicitation, including an offeror under a negotiated\
acquisition.\

\f2\i Bond 
\f1\i0 means a written instrument executed by a bidder or contractor (the "principal"), and a second party (the "surety" or\
"sureties") (except as provided in \cf3 28.204\cf4 ), to assure fulfillment of the principal\'92s obligations to a third party (the "obligee" or "Government"), identified in the bond. If the principal\'92s obligations are not met, the bond assures payment, to the extent stipulated, of any loss sustained by the obligee. The types of bonds and related documents are as follows:\
(1) An advance payment bond secures fulfillment of the contractor\'92s obligations under an advance payment provision.\
(2) An annual bid bond is a single bond furnished by a bidder, in lieu of separate bonds, which secure all bids (on other than construction contracts) requiring bonds submitted during a specific Government fiscal year.\
(3) An annual performance bond is a single bond furnished by a contractor, in lieu of separate performance bonds, to secure fulfillment of the contractor\'92s obligations under contracts (other than construction contracts) requiring bonds entered into during a specific Government fiscal year.\
(4) A patent infringement bond secures fulfillment of the contractor\'92s obligations under a patent provision.\
(5) A payment bond assures payments as required by law to all persons supplying labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract.\
(6) A performance bond secures performance and fulfillment of the contractor\'92s obligations under the contract. 
\f2\i Consent of surety 
\f1\i0 means an acknowledgment by a surety that its bond given in connection with a contract continues to\
apply to the contract as modified.\

\f2\i Penal sum 
\f1\i0 or "penal amount" means the amount of money specified in a bond (or a percentage of the bid price in a bid\
bond) as the maximum payment for which the surety is obligated or the amount of security required to be pledged to the Government in lieu of a corporate or individual surety for the bond.\

\f2\i Reinsurance 
\f1\i0 means a transaction which provides that a surety, for a consideration, agrees to indemnify another surety against loss which the latter may sustain under a bond which it has issued.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 28.1 - Bonds and Other Financial Protections\

\fs20 28.100 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes requirements and procedures for the use of bonds, alternative payment protections, and all types of bid guarantees.\

\f0\b 28.101 Bid guarantees.\
28.101-1 Policy on use.\

\f1\b0 (a) A contracting officer shall not require a bid guarantee unless a performance bond or a performance and payment bond is also required (see \cf3 28.102 \cf4 and \cf3 28.103\cf4 ). Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, bid guarantees shall be required whenever a performance bond or a performance and payment bond is required.\

\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (b) All types of bid guarantees are acceptable for supply or service contracts (see annual bid bonds and annual performance bonds coverage in \cf3 28.001\cf4 ). Only separate bid guarantees are acceptable in connection with construction contracts. Agencies may specify that only separate bid bonds are acceptable in connection with construction contracts.\
(c) The chief of the contracting office may waive the requirement to obtain a bid guarantee when a performance bond or a performance and payment bond is required if it is determined that a bid guarantee is not in the best interest of the Government for a specific acquisition (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 overseas construction, emergency acquisitions, sole-source contracts). Class waivers may be authorized by the agency head or designee.\

\f0\b 28.101-2 Solicitation provision or contract clause.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert a provision or clause substantially the same as the provision at \cf3 52.228-1\cf4 , Bid Guarantee, in solicitations or contracts that require a bid guarantee or similar guarantee. For example, the contracting officer may modify this provision-\
(1) To set a period of time that is other than 10 days for the return of executed bonds;\
(2) For use in connection with construction solicitations when the agency has specified that only separate bid bonds are acceptable in accordance with \cf3 28.101-1\cf4 (b);\
(3) For use in solicitations for negotiated contracts; or\
(4) For use in service contracts containing options for extended performance.\
(b) The contracting officer shall determine the amount of the bid guarantee for insertion in the provision at \cf3 52.228-1 \cf4 (see\
\cf3 28.102-2\cf4 (a)). The amount shall be adequate to protect the Government from loss should the successful bidder fail to execute further contractual documents and bonds as required. The bid guarantee amount shall be at least 20 percent of the bid price but shall not exceed $3 million. When the penal sum is expressed as a percentage, a maximum dollar limitation may be stated.\

\f0\b 28.101-3 Authority of an attorney-in-fact for a bid bond.\

\f1\b0 (a) Any person signing a bid bond as an attorney-in-fact shall include with the bid bond evidence of authority to bind the surety.\
(b) An original, or a photocopy or facsimile of an original, power of attorney is sufficient evidence of such authority.\
(c) For purposes of this section, electronic, mechanically-applied and printed signatures, seals and dates on the power of attorney shall be considered original signatures, seals and dates, without regard to the order in which they were affixed.\
(d) The contracting officer shall-\
(1) Treat the failure to provide a signed and dated power of attorney at the time of bid opening as a matter of\
responsiveness; and\
(2) Treat questions regarding the authenticity and enforceability of the power of attorney at the time of bid opening as a\
matter of responsibility. These questions are handled after bid opening.\
(e) (1) If the contracting officer contacts the surety to validate the power of attorney, the contracting officer shall\
document the file providing, at a minimum, the following information: (i) Name of person contacted.\
(ii) Date and time of contact.\
(iii) Response of the surety.\
(2) If, upon investigation, the surety declares the power of attorney to have been valid at the time of bid opening, the\
contracting officer may require correction of any technical error.\
(3) If the surety declares the power of attorney to have been invalid, the contracting officer shall not allow the bidder to\
substitute a replacement power of attorney or a replacement surety.\
(f) Determinations of non-responsibility based on the unacceptability of a power of attorney are not subject to the\
Certificate of Competency process of subpart \cf3 19.6 \cf4 if the surety has disavowed the validity of the power of attorney.\

\f0\b 28.101-4 Noncompliance with bid guarantee requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) In sealed bidding, noncompliance with a solicitation requirement for a bid guarantee requires rejection of the bid, except in the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection when the noncompliance shall be waived.\
(b) In negotiation, noncompliance with a solicitation requirement for a bid guarantee requires rejection of an initial proposal as unacceptable, if a determination is made to award the contract based on initial proposals without discussion, except in the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection when noncompliance shall be waived. (See \cf3 15.306\cf4 (a)(2) for conditions regarding making awards based on initial proposals.) If the conditions for awarding based on initial proposals\

\fs24 Subpart 28.2 - Sureties and Other Security for Bonds\

\fs20 28.200 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart prescribes procedures for the use of sureties and other security to protect the Government from financial losses.\

\f0\b 28.201 Requirements for security.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall obtain adequate security for bonds (including coinsurance and reinsurance agreements) required or used with a contract for supplies or services (including construction). Acceptable forms of security include-\
(1) Corporate or individual sureties; or\
(2) Any of the types of security authorized in lieu of sureties by \cf3 28.204\cf4 .\
(b) Solicitations shall not preclude offerors from using the types of surety or other security permitted by this subpart,\
unless prohibited by law or regulation.\

\f0\b 28.202 Acceptability of corporate sureties.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Corporate sureties offered for bonds furnished with contracts performed in the United States or its outlying areas must appear on the list contained in the Department of the Treasury's Listing of Approved Sureties (Treasury Department Circular 570), \'93Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies.\'94\
(2) The penal amount of the bond should not exceed the surety's underwriting limit stated in the Treasury Department Circular 570. If the penal amount exceeds the underwriting limit, the bond will be acceptable only if-\
(i) The amount which exceeds the specified limit is coinsured or reinsured; and\
(ii) The amount of coinsurance or reinsurance does not exceed the underwriting limit of each coinsurer or reinsurer. (3) Coinsurance or reinsurance agreements shall conform to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) regulations\
in 31 CFR 223.10 and 223.11. When reinsurance is contemplated, the contracting office generally shall require reinsurance agreements to be executed and submitted with the bonds before making a final determination on the bonds.\
(4) When specified in the solicitation, the contracting officer may accept a bond from the direct writing company in satisfaction of the total bond requirement of the contract. This is permissible until necessary reinsurance agreements are executed, even though the total bond requirement may exceed the insurer's underwriting limitation. The contractor shall execute and submit necessary reinsurance agreements to the contracting officer within the time specified on the bid form, which may not exceed 45 calendar days after the execution of the bond. The contractor shall use \cf3 Standard Form (SF) 273\cf4 , Reinsurance Agreement for a Bonds Statute Performance Bond, and \cf3 SF 274\cf4 , Reinsurance Agreement for a Bonds Statute Payment Bond, when reinsurance is furnished with the required performance or payment bonds. \cf3 SF 275\cf4 , Reinsurance Agreement in Favor of the United States, is used when reinsurance is furnished with bonds for other purposes.\
(b) For contracts performed in a foreign country, sureties not appearing on Treasury Department Circular 570 are acceptable if the contracting officer determines that it is impracticable for the contractor to use Treasury listed sureties.\
(c) Treasury issues supplements to Treasury Department Circular 570, notifying all Federal agencies of new approved corporate surety companies and the termination of the authority of any specific corporate surety to qualify as a surety on Federal bonds. Upon receipt of notification of termination of a company\'92s authority to qualify as a surety on Federal bonds, the contracting officer shall review the outstanding contracts and take action necessary to protect the Government, including, where appropriate, securing new bonds with acceptable sureties in lieu of outstanding bonds with the named company.\
(d) Treasury Department Circular 570 may be obtained from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Surety Bond Branch, 3201 Pennsy Drive, Building E, Landover, MD 20785 or at \cf3 https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ fsreports/ref/suretyBnd/c570.htm\cf4 .\

\f0\b 28.203 Individual Sureties.\
28.203-1 Acceptability of individual sureties.\

\f1\b0 (a) An individual surety is acceptable for all types of bonds except position schedule bonds. Assets pledged by an individual surety shall meet the eligibility requirements of Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Per 31 U.S.C. 9310, individual sureties must pledge eligible obligations, which Treasury refers to as acceptable collateral or eligible collateral. A list of acceptable assets, entitled \'93Acceptable Collateral for 31 CFR part 225,\'94 may be accessed by going to \cf3 https://\

(b) (1) An individual surety shall execute the bond (
\f2\i e.g.
\f1\i0 , bid bond (\cf3 SF 24\cf4 ), performance bond (\cf3 SF 25\cf4 ), payment bond (\cf3 SF 25A\cf4 )).\
(2) The net adjusted value of unencumbered assets is their market value minus the margin. The margin tables are available at www.treasurydirect.gov. The net adjusted value of unencumbered assets pledged by the individual surety must equal or exceed the penal amount (
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , face value) of each bond.\
(3) The individual surety shall execute the \cf3 SF 28\cf4 , Affidavit of Individual Surety, and provide a security interest. One individual surety is adequate support for a bond, provided the net adjusted value of unencumbered assets pledged by that individual surety equals or exceeds the amount of the bond.\
(4) An offeror or contractor may submit up to three individual sureties for each bond, in which case the net adjusted value of the pledged unencumbered assets, when combined, must equal or exceed the penal amount of the bond. Each individual surety is jointly and severally liable to the extent of the penal amount of the bond.\
(c) Using the information from the \cf3 SF 28 \cf4 submitted by the offeror or contractor, the contracting officer shall notify the Treasury's collateral operations support team by email at \cf3 BMT@fiscal.treasury.gov \cf4 or by phone at 888-568-7343, of the individual surety, the assets to be pledged, and the amount necessary to cover the individual surety bond, 
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , the required amount to be collateralized. Treasury will advise the contracting officer whether the assets are eligible to be pledged, consistent with \cf3 28.203-1\cf4 (a), and of the valuation of the assets offered to be pledged, consistent with the valuation standards in \cf3 28.203-1\cf4 (b)(2). If after 3 business days the contracting officer has not received a response from Treasury, the contracting officer may seek assistance from the Director, Bank Policy and Oversight, at 202-504-3502. The contracting officer shall determine whether the individual surety bond is acceptable as to the amount necessary to cover the individual surety bond based on the asset eligibility and valuation assessment from Treasury. The contracting officer shall notify both the offeror or contractor and the individual surety of this determination.\
(d) If the contracting officer determines the individual surety is acceptable, the contracting officer shall request the Treasury's collateral operations support team set up the necessary individual surety pledged asset collateral account.\
(e) If the contracting officer determines that no individual surety in support of a bid guarantee is acceptable, the\
offeror utilizing the individual surety shall be rejected as nonresponsible, except as provided in \cf3 28.101-4\cf4 . A finding of nonresponsibility based on unacceptability of an individual surety, need not be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency. (See \cf3 19.602-1\cf4 (a) and 61 Comp. Gen. 456 (1982).)\
(f) If a contractor submits an unacceptable individual surety, or one that Treasury could not assess the asset eligibility and valuation within a reasonable time, then the contracting officer may permit the contractor to substitute an acceptable surety within a reasonable time.\
(g) Evidence of possible criminal or fraudulent activities by an individual surety shall be referred to the appropriate agency official in accordance with agency procedures.\

\f0\b 28.203-2 Substitution of assets.\

\f1\b0 An individual surety may request the Government to accept a substitute asset for that currently pledged by submitting a written request, including a revised \cf3 SF 28\cf4 , to the responsible contracting officer. Following the requirements set forth in \cf3 28.203-1\cf4 , the contracting officer may agree to the substitution of assets upon determining that the substitute assets to be pledged are adequate to protect the outstanding bond or guarantee obligations.\

\f0\b 28.203-3 Release of security interest.\

\f1\b0 (a) After consultation with legal counsel, the contracting officer shall release the security interest on the individual surety's assets using the Optional Form 91, Release of Personal Property from Escrow, or a similar release as soon as possible consistent with the conditions in subparagraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. A surety's assets pledged in support of a payment bond may be released to a subcontractor or supplier upon Government receipt of a Federal district court judgment, or a sworn statement by the subcontractor or supplier that the claim is correct along with a notarized authorization of the release by the surety stating that it approves of such release.\

\f1\i0 The security interest shall be maintained for 90 days following final payment or until completion of any warranty period (applicable only to performance bonds), whichever is later.\
(b) Upon written request by the individual surety, the contracting officer may release the security interest on the individual surety's assets in support of a bid guarantee based upon evidence that the offer supported by the individual surety will not result in contract award.\
(c) Upon written request by the individual surety, the contracting officer may release a portion of the security interest on the individual surety's assets based upon substantial performance of the contractor's obligations under its performance bond. Release of the security interest in support of a payment bond must comply with the subparagraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. In making this determination, the contracting officer will give consideration as to whether the unreleased portion of the security is sufficient to cover the remaining contract obligations, including payments to subcontractors and other potential liabilities. The individual surety shall, as a condition of the partial release, furnish an affidavit agreeing that the release of such assets does not relieve the individual surety of its obligations under the bond(s).\

\f1\b0 (a) An individual may be excluded from acting as a surety on bonds submitted by offerors on procurement by the executive branch of the Federal Government, by the acquiring agency's head or designee utilizing the procedures in \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 . The exclusion shall be for the purpose of protecting the Government.\
(b) An individual may be excluded for any of the following causes:\
(1) Failure to fulfill the obligations under any bond.\
(2) Failure to disclose all bond obligations.\
(3) Misrepresentation of the value of available assets or outstanding liabilities.\
(4) Any false or misleading statement, signature or representation on a bond or affidavit of individual suretyship.\
(5) Any other cause affecting responsibility as a surety of such serious and compelling nature as may be determined to\
warrant exclusion.\
(c) An individual surety excluded pursuant to this section shall be entered as an exclusion in the System for Award\
Management (see \cf3 9.404\cf4 ).\
(d) Contracting officers shall not accept the bonds of individual sureties whose names appear in an active exclusion record\
in the System for Award Management (see \cf3 9.404\cf4 ) unless the acquiring agency's head or a designee states in writing the compelling reasons justifying acceptance.\
(e) An exclusion of an individual surety under this section will also preclude such party from acting as a contractor in accordance with \cf3 subpart 9.4\cf4 .\

\f0\b 28.204 Alternatives in lieu of corporate or individual sureties.\

\f1\b0 (a) Any person required to furnish a bond to the Government may furnish any of the types of security listed in \cf3 28.204-1 \cf4 through \cf3 28.204-3 \cf4 instead of a corporate or individual surety for the bond. When any of those types of security are deposited, a statement shall be incorporated in the bond form pledging the security in lieu of execution of the bond form by corporate or individual sureties. The contractor shall execute the bond forms as the principal. Agencies shall establish safeguards to protect against loss of the security and shall return the security or its equivalent to the contractor when the bond obligation has ceased.\
(b) Upon written request by any contractor securing a performance or payment bond by any of the types of security listed in \cf3 28.204-1 \cf4 through \cf3 28.204-3\cf4 , the contracting officer may release a portion of the security only when the conditions allowing the partial release of security in \cf3 28.203-3\cf4 (c) are met. The contractor shall, as a condition of the partial release, furnish an affidavit agreeing that the release of such security does not relieve the contractor of its obligations under the bond(s).\

\f0\b 28.204-1 United States bonds or notes.\

\f1\b0 Any person required to furnish a bond to the Government has the option, instead of furnishing a surety or sureties on the bond, of depositing certain United States bonds or notes in an amount equal at their par value to the penal sum of the bond (the Act of February 24,1919 (\cf3 31 U.S.C.9303\cf4 ) and Treasury Department Circular No.154 (31 CFR Part 225)). In addition, a duly executed power of attorney and agreement authorizing the collection or sale of such United States bonds or notes in the event of default of the principal on the bond shall accompany the deposited bonds or notes. The contracting officer may-\
(a) Turn securities over to the finance or other authorized agency official; or\
(b) Deposit them with the Treasurer of the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank (or branch with requisite facilities), or other depository designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury, under procedures prescribed by the agency concerned and Treasury Department CircularNo.154 (exception: The contracting officer shall deposit all bonds and notes received in the District of Columbia with the Treasurer of the United States).\

\f0\b 28.204-2 Certified or cashier\'92s checks, bank drafts, money orders, or currency.\

\f1\b0 Any person required to furnish a bond has an option to furnish a certified or cashier\'92s check, bank draft, Post Office money order, or currency, in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond, instead of furnishing surety or sureties on the bonds. Those furnishing checks, drafts, or money orders shall draw them to the order of the appropriate Federal agency.\

\f0\b 28.204-3 Irrevocable letter of credit.\

\f1\b0 (a) Any person required to furnish a bond has the option to furnish a bond secured by an irrevocable letter of credit (ILC) in an amount equal to the penal sum required to be secured (see \cf3 28.204\cf4 ). A separate ILC is required for each bond.\
(b) The ILC shall be irrevocable, require presentation of no document other than a written demand and the ILC (and letter of confirmation, if any), expire only as provided in paragraph (f) of this subsection, and be issued/confirmed by an acceptable federally insured financial institution as provided in paragraph (g) of this subsection.\
(c) To draw on the ILC, the contracting officer shall use the sight draft set forth in the clause at \cf3 52.228-14\cf4 , and present it with the ILC (including letter of confirmation, if any) to the issuing financial institution or the confirming financial institution (if any).\
(d) If the contractor does not furnish an acceptable replacement ILC, or other acceptable substitute, at least 30 days before an ILC\'92s scheduled expiration, the contracting officer shall immediately draw on the ILC.\
(e) If, after the period of performance of a contract where ILCs are used to support payment bonds, there are outstanding claims against the payment bond, the contracting officer shall draw on the ILC prior to the expiration date of the ILC to cover these claims.\
(f) The period for which financial security is required shall be as follows:\
(1) If used as a bid guarantee, the ILC should expire no earlier than 60 days after the close of the bid acceptance period. (2) If used as an alternative to corporate or individual sureties as security for a performance or payment bond, the\
offeror/contractor may submit an ILC with an initial expiration date estimated to cover the entire period for which financial security is required or an ILC with an initial expiration date that is a minimum period of oneyear from the date of issuance. The ILC shall provide that, unless the issuer provides the beneficiary written notice of non-renewal at least 60 days in advance of the current expiration date, the ILC is automatically extended without amendment for oneyear from the expiration date, or any future expiration date, until the period of required coverage is completed and the contracting officer provides the financial institution with a written statement waiving the right to payment. The period of required coverage shall be:\
(i) For contracts subject to the Bonds statute, the later of-\
(A) Oneyear following the expected date of final payment;\
(B) For performance bonds only, until completion of any warranty period; or\
(C) For payment bonds only, until resolution of all claims filed against the payment bond during the one-year\
period following final payment.\
(ii) For contracts not subject to the Bonds statute, the later of-\
(A) 90 days following final payment; or\

(2) To support the credit rating of the financial institution(s) issuing or confirming the ILC, the contracting officer shall verify the following information:\
(i) Federal insurance: Each financial institution is federally insured. Verification of federal insurance is available through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) institution directory at the website \cf3 http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/ index.asp\cf4 .\
(ii) Current credit rating. The current credit rating for each financial institution is investment grade and that the credit rating is from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO). NRSROs can be located at the website \cf3 http://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm \cf4 maintained by the SEC.\
(3) The rating services listed in the website \cf3 http://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm \cf4 use different rating scales (e.g., AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and D; or Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C) to provide evaluations of institutional credit risk; however, all such systems specify the range of investment grade ratings (e.g., BBB-AAA or Baa- Aaa in the examples in this section) and permit evaluation of the relative risk associated with a specific institution. If the contracting officer learns that a financial institution's rating has dropped below investment grade level, the contracting officer shall give the contractor 30 days to substitute an acceptable ILC or shall draw on the ILC using the sight draft in paragraph (g) of the clause at \cf3 52.228-14\cf4 .\

\fs24 Subpart 28.3 - Insurance\

\f1\b0\fs20 Contractors shall carry insurance under the following circumstances:\
(a) (1) The Government requires any contractor subject to Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 416 (48 CFR 9004.416) to obtain insurance, by purchase or self-coverage, for the perils to which the contractor is exposed, except when-\
(i) The Government, by providing in the contract in accordance with law, agrees to indemnify the contractor under specified circumstances; or\
(ii) The contract specifically relieves the contractor of liability for loss of or damage to Government property.\
(2) The Government reserves the right to disapprove the purchase of any insurance coverage not in the Government\'92s\
interest.\
(3) Allowability of the insurance program\'92s cost shall be determined in accordance with the criteria in \cf3 31.205-19\cf4 .\
(b) Contractors, whether or not their contracts are subject to CAS 416, are required by law and this regulation to provide insurance for certain types of perils (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 workers\'92 compensation). Insurance is mandatory also when commingling of property, type of operation, circumstances of ownership, or condition of the contract make it necessary for the protection\
of the Government. The minimum amounts of insurance required by this regulation (see \cf3 28.307-2\cf4 ) may be reduced when\
a contract is to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas. When more than one agency is involved, the agency responsible for review and approval of a contractor\'92s insurance program shall coordinate with other interested agencies before acting on significant insurance matters.\
(c) Contractors awarded nonpersonal services contracts for health care services are required to maintain medical liability insurance and indemnify the Government for liability producing acts or omissions by the contractor, its employees and agents (see \cf3 37.400\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 28.302 Notice of cancellation or change.\

\f1\b0 When the Government requires the contractor to provide insurance coverage, the policies shall contain an endorsement that any cancellation or material change in the coverage adversely affecting the Government\'92s interest shall not be effective unless the insurer or the contractor gives written notice of cancellation or change as required by the contracting officer. When the coverage is provided by self-insurance, the contractor shall not change or decrease the coverage without the administrative contracting officer\'92s prior approval (see \cf3 28.308\cf4 (c)).\

\f0\b 28.303 Insurance against loss of or damage to Government property.\

\f1\b0 When the Government requires or approves insurance to cover loss of or damage to Government property (see \cf3 45.104\cf4 , Responsibility and liability for Government property), it may be provided by specific insurance policies or by inclusion of the risks in the contractor\'92s existing policies. The policies shall disclose the Government\'92s interest in the property.\

\f0\b 28.304 Risk-pooling arrangements.\

\f1\b0 Agencies may establish risk-pooling arrangements. These arrangements are designed to use the services of the insurance industry for safety engineering and the handling of claims at minimum cost to the Government. The agency responsible shall appoint a single manager or point of contact for each arrangement.\

\f0\b 28.305 Overseas workers\'92 compensation and war-hazard insurance.\

\f1\b0 (a) "Public-work contract," as used in this subpart, means any contract for a fixed improvement or for any other project, fixed or not, for the public use of the United States or its allies, involving construction, alteration, removal, or repair, including projects or operations under service contracts and projects in connection with the national defense or with war activities, dredging, harbor improvements, dams, roadways, and housing, as well as preparatory and ancillary work in connection therewith at the site or on the project.\
(b) The Defense Base Act (\cf3 42 U.S.C.1651\cf4 , 
\f2\i etseq
\f1\i0 .) extends the Longshoremen\'92s and Harbor Workers\'92 Compensation Act (\cf3 33 U.S.C.901\cf4 ) to various classes of employees working outside the United States, including those engaged in performing-\
(1) Public-work contracts; or\
(2) Contracts approved or financed under the Foreign Assistance Act of1961 (Pub.L.87-195) other than-\
(i) Contracts approved or financed by the Development Loan Fund (unless the Secretary of Labor, acting upon the recommendation of a department or agency, determines that such contracts should be covered); or\
(ii) Contracts exclusively for materials or supplies.\

\fs20 (c) When the Defense Base Act applies (see \cf3 42 U.S.C.1651\cf4 , 
\f2\i etseq
\f1\i0 .) to these employees, the benefits of the Longshoremen\'92s and Harbor Workers\'92 Compensation Act are extended through operation of the War Hazards Compensation Act (\cf3 42 U.S.C.1701\cf4 , 
\f2\i etseq
\f1\i0 .) to protect the employees against the risk of war hazards (injury, death, capture, or detention). When, by means of an insurance policy or a self-insurance program, the contractor provides the workers\'92 compensation coverage required by the Defense Base Act, the contractor\'92s employees automatically receive war-hazard risk protection.\
(d) When the agency head recommends a waiver to the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary may waive the applicability of the Defense Base Act to any contract, subcontract, work location, or classification of employees.\
(e) If the Defense Base Act is waived for some or all of the contractor\'92s employees, the benefits of the War Hazards Compensation Act are automatically waived with respect to those employees for whom the Defense Base Act is waived. For those employees, the contractor shall provide workers\'92 compensation coverage against the risk of work injury or death and assume liability toward the employees and their beneficiaries for war-hazard injury, death, capture, or detention. The contract shall provide either that the costs of this liability or the reasonable costs of insurance against this liability shall be allowed as a cost under the contract.\

\f0\b 28.306 Insurance under fixed-price contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . Although the Government is not ordinarily concerned with the contractor\'92s insurance coverage if the contract is a fixed-price contract, in special circumstances agencies may specify insurance requirements under fixed-price contracts. Examples of such circumstances include the following:\
(1) The contractor is, or has a separate operation, engaged principally in Government work.\
(2) Government property is involved.\
(3) The work is to be performed on a Government installation.\
(4) The Government elects to assume risks for which the contractor ordinarily obtains commercial insurance.\
(b) Work on a Government installation. (1) When the clause at \cf3 52.228-5\cf4 , Insurance-Work on a Government Installation, is required to be included in a fixed-price contract by \cf3 28.310\cf4 , the coverage specified in \cf3 28.307 \cf4 is the minimum insurance required and shall be included in the contract Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The contracting officer may require additional coverage and higher limits.\
(2) When the clause at \cf3 52.228-5\cf4 , Insurance-Work on a Government Installation, is not required by \cf3 28.310 \cf4 but is included because the contracting officer considers it to be in the Government\'92s interest to do so, any of the types of insurance specified in \cf3 28.307 \cf4 may be omitted or the limits may be lowered, if appropriate.\

\f0\b 28.307 Insurance under cost-reimbursement contracts.\

\f1\b0 Cost-reimbursement contracts (and subcontracts, if the terms of the prime contract are extended to the subcontract) ordinarily require the types of insurance listed in \cf3 28.307-2\cf4 , with the minimum amounts of liability indicated. (See \cf3 28.308 \cf4 for self-insurance.)\

\f0\b 28.307-1 Group insurance plans.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Prior approval requirement
\f1\i0 . Under cost-reimbursement contracts, before buying insurance under a group insurance plan, the contractor must submit the plan for approval, in accordance with agency regulations. Any change in benefits provided under an approved plan that can reasonably be expected to increase significantly the cost to the Government requires similar approval.\
(b) 
\f2\i Premium refunds or credits
\f1\i0 . The plan shall provide for the Government to share in any premium refunds or credits paid or otherwise allowed to the contractor. In determining the extent of the Government\'92s share in any premium refunds or credits, any special reserves and other refunds to which the contractor may be entitled in the future shall be taken into account.\

\f0\b 28.307-2 Liability.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Workers\'92 compensation and employer\'92s liability
\f1\i0 . Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers\'92 compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer\'92s liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a contractor\'92s commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer\'92s liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers\'92 compensation to be written by private carriers. (See \cf3 28.305\cf4 (c) for treatment of contracts subject to the Defense Base Act.)\

\f1\b0 (b) General liability. (1) The contracting officer shall require bodily injury liability insurance coverage written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $500,000 per occurrence.\
(2) Property damage liability insurance shall be required only in special circumstances as determined by the agency. (c) 
\f2\i Automobile liability
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall require automobile liability insurance written on the comprehensive\
form of policy. The policy shall provide for bodily injury and property damage liability covering the operation of all automobiles used in connection with performing the contract. Policies covering automobiles operated in the United States shall provide coverage of at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.\
(d) 
\f2\i Aircraft public and passenger liability
\f1\i0 . When aircraft are used in connection with performing the contract, the contracting officer shall require aircraft public and passenger liability insurance. Coverage shall be at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other than passenger liability, and $200,000 per occurrence for property damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury shall be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is greater.\
(e) 
\f2\i Vessel liability
\f1\i0 . When contract performance involves use of vessels, the contracting officer shall require, as determined by the agency, vessel collision liability and protection and indemnity liability insurance.\

\f0\b 28.308 Self-insurance.\

\f1\b0 (a) When it is anticipated that 50 percent or more of the self-insurance costs to be incurred at a segment of a contractor\'92s business will be allocable to negotiated Government contracts, and the self-insurance costs at the segment for the contractor\'92s fiscal year are expected to be $200,000 or more, the contractor shall submit, in writing, information on its proposed self- insurance program to the administrative contracting officer and obtain that official\'92s approval of the program. The submission shall be by segment or segments of the contractor\'92s business to which the program applies and shall include-\
(1) A complete description of the program, including any resolution of the board of directors authorizing and adopting coverage, including types of risks, limits of coverage, assignments of safety and loss control, and legal service responsibilities;\
(2) If available, the corporate insurance manual and organization chart detailing fiscal responsibilities for insurance; (3) The terms regarding insurance coverage for any Government property;\
(4) The contractor\'92s latest financial statements;\
(5) Any self-insurance feasibility studies or insurance market surveys reporting comparative alternatives;\
(6) Loss history, premiums history, and industry ratios;\
(7) A formula for establishing reserves, including percentage variations between losses paid and losses reserved;\
(8) Claims administration policy, practices, and procedures;\
(9) The method of calculating the projected average loss; and\
(10) A disclosure of all captive insurance company and reinsurance agreements, including methods of computing cost.\
(b) Programs of self-insurance covering a contractor\'92s insurable risks, including the deductible portion of purchased insurance, may be approved when examination of a program indicates that its application is in the Government\'92s interest. Agencies shall not approve a program of self-insurance for workers\'92 compensation in a jurisdiction where workers\'92 compensation does not completely cover the employer\'92s liability to employees, unless the contractor-\
(1) Maintains an approved program of self-insurance for any employer\'92s liability not so covered; or\
(2) Shows that the combined cost to the Government of self-insurance for workers\'92 compensation and commercial insurance for employer\'92s liability will not exceed the cost of covering both kinds of risk by commercial insurance.\
(c) Once the administrative contracting officer has approved a program, the contractor must submit to that official for approval any major proposed changes to the program. Any program approval may be withdrawn if a contracting officer finds that either-\
(1) Any part of a program does not comply with the requirements of this subpart and/or the criteria at \cf3 31.205-19\cf4 ; or\
(2) Conditions or situations existing at the time of approval that were a basis for original approval of the program have changed to the extent that a program change is necessary.\
(d) To qualify for a self-insurance program, a contractor must demonstrate ability to sustain the potential losses involved. In making the determination, the contracting officer shall consider the following factors:\
(1) The soundness of the contractor\'92s financial condition, including available lines of credit.\
(2) The geographic dispersion of assets, so that the potential of a single loss depleting all the assets is unlikely. (3) The history of previous losses, including frequency of occurrence and the financial impact of each loss.\

\f0\b 28.310 Contract clause for work on a Government installation.\

\f1\b0 (a) Insert the clause at \cf3 52.228-5\cf4 , Insurance-Work on a Government Installation, in solicitations and contracts if a fixed- price contract is contemplated, the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and the contract will require work on a Government installation, unless-\
(1) Only a small amount of work is required on the Government installation (
\f2\i e.g.,
\f1\i0 a few brief visits permonth); or\
(2) All work on the Government installation will be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas.\
(b) The contracting officer may insert the clause at \cf3 52.228-5 \cf4 in solicitations and contracts described in paragraphs (a)(1)\

\f0\b 28.311 Solicitation provision and contract clause on liability insurance under cost-reimbursement contracts.\
28.311-1 Contract clause.\

\f1\b0 In accordance with agency acquisition regulations, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.228-7\cf4 , Insurance- Liability to Third Persons, in solicitations and contracts, other than those for construction contracts and those for architect- engineer services, when a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated.\

\f0\b 28.311-2 Agency solicitation provisions and contract clauses.\

\f0\b 28.313 Contract clauses for insurance of transportation or transportation-related services.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.228-9\cf4 , Cargo Insurance, in solicitations and contracts for transportation or for transportation-related services, except when freight is shipped under rates subject to released or declared value.\
(b) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as that at \cf3 52.228-10\cf4 , Vehicular and General Public Liability Insurance, in solicitations and contracts for transportation or for transportation-related services when the contracting officer determines that vehicular liability or general public liability insurance required by law is not sufficient.\

(2) Obtaining exemption from, or refund of, a tax.\
(c) When the constitutional immunity of the Government from State or local taxation may reasonably be at issue,\
contractors should be discouraged from negotiating independently with taxing authorities if the contract involved is either- (1) A cost-reimbursement contract; or\
(2) A fixed-price contract containing a tax escalation clause.\
(d) Before purchasing goods or services from a foreign source, the contracting officer should consult the agency- designated counsel-\
(1) For information on foreign tax treaties and agreements in force and on the implementation of any foreign-tax-relief programs; and\

\fs24 Subpart 29.2 - Federal Excise Taxes\

\fs20 29.201 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Federal excise taxes are levied on the sale or use of particular supplies or services. Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Miscellaneous Excise Taxes, \cf3 26 U.S.C.4041\cf4 , 
\f2\i etseq
\f1\i0 ., and its implementing regulations, 26 CFR parts 40 through 299, cover miscellaneous federal excise tax requirements. Questions arising in this area should be directed to the agency-designated counsel. The most common excise taxes are-\
(1) Manufacturers\'92 excise taxes imposed on certain motor-vehicle articles, tires and inner tubes, gasoline, lubricating oils, coal, fishing equipment, firearms, shells, and cartridges sold by manufacturers, producers, or importers; and\
(2) Special-fuels excise taxes imposed at the retail level on diesel fuel and special motor fuels.\
(b) Sometimes the law exempts the Federal Government from these taxes. Contracting officers should solicit prices on a tax-exclusive basis when it is known that the Government is exempt from these taxes, and on a tax-inclusive basis when no\
exemption exists.\
(c) Executive agencies shall take maximum advantage of available Federal excise tax exemptions.\

\f0\b 29.202 General exemptions.\

\f1\b0 No Federal manufacturers\'92 or special-fuels excise taxes are imposed in many contracting situations as, for example, when the supplies are for any of the following:\
(a) The exclusive use of any State or political subdivision, including the District of Columbia (\cf3 26 U.S.C.4041 \cf4 and 4221).\
(b) Shipment for export to a foreign country or an outlying area of the United States. Shipment must occur within 6 months of the time title passes to the Government. When the exemption is claimed, the words "for export" must appear on the contract or purchase document, and the contracting officer must furnish the seller proof of export (see 26 CFR48.4221-3).\
(c) Further manufacture, or resale for further manufacture (this exemption does not include tires and inner tubes) (26 CFR 48.4221-2).\
(d) Use as fuel supplies, ships or sea stores, or legitimate equipment on vessels of war, including (1) aircraft owned by\
the United States and constituting a part of the armed forces and (2) guided missiles and pilotless aircraft owned or chartered by the United States. When this exemption is to be claimed, the purchase should be made on a tax-exclusive basis. The contracting officer shall furnish the seller an exemption certificate for Supplies for Vessels of War (an example is given in 26 CFR 48.4221-4(d)(2) ; the IRS will accept one certificate covering all orders under a single contract for a specified period of up to 12 calendar quarters) (\cf3 26 U.S.C.4041 \cf4 and \cf3 4 221\cf4 ).\
(e) A nonprofit educational organization (\cf3 26 U.S.C.4041 \cf4 and \cf3 4 221\cf4 ). (f) Emergency vehicles (\cf3 26 U.S.C.4053 \cf4 and \cf3 4 064(b)(1)(c)\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 29.203 Other Federal tax exemptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) Pursuant to \cf3 26 U.S.C.4293\cf4 , the Secretary of the Treasury has exempted the United States from the communications excise tax imposed in \cf3 26 U.S.C.4251\cf4 , when the supplies and services are for the exclusive use of the United States. (Secretarial Authorization, June 20,1947, Internal Revenue Cumulative Bulletin,1947-1, 205.)\
(b) Pursuant to \cf3 26 U.S.C.4483(b)\cf4 , the Secretary of the Treasury has exempted the United States from the federal highway vehicle users tax imposed in \cf3 26 U.S.C.4481\cf4 . The exemption applies whether the vehicle is owned or leased by the United States. (Secretarial Authorization, Internal Revenue Cumulative Bulletin,1956-2, 1369.)\

\f0\b 29.204 Federal excise tax on specific foreign contract payments.\

\f1\b0 (a) Title 26 U.S.C. 5000C and its implementing regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 require acquiring agencies to collect this excise tax via withholding on applicable contract payments (see \cf3 29.402-3\cf4 , 31.205-41(b)(8)). Agencies merely withhold the tax (section 5000C tax) for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). All substantive issues regarding the underlying section 5000C tax, e.g., the imposition of, and exemption from the tax, are matters under the jurisdiction of the IRS. The contracting officer will refer all questions relating to the interpretation of the IRS regulations to \cf3 https://www.irs.gov/ help/tax-law-questions\cf4 .\
(b) In accordance with the clause \cf3 52.229-12\cf4 , Tax on Certain Foreign Procurements, contractors that are subject to the section 5000C tax will complete IRS Form W-14, Certificate of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments, and submit this form with each voucher or invoice. In the absence of a completed IRS Form W-14 accompanying a payment request, the default withholding percentage is 2 percent for the section 5000C withholding for that payment request. Information about IRS Form W-14 is available via the internet at \cf3 www.irs.gov/w14\cf4 .\

\f1\i0 ., the contracting officer will not include the provision when one of the \cf3 29.402-3\cf4 (a) exceptions applies).\
(2) The exemptions at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1(d)(5) through (7) must be claimed by the offeror when it submits an IRS Form W-14 with the offer. If not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to the contract.\
(3) Any exemption claimed and self-certified on the IRS Form W-14 is subject to audit by the IRS. Any disputes regarding the imposition and collection of the section 5000C tax are adjudicated by the IRS as the section 5000C tax is a tax matter, not a contract issue.\

\fs24 Subpart 29.3 - State and Local Taxes\

\f1\b0\fs20 This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures regarding the exemption or immunity of Federal Government purchases and property from State and local taxation.\

\f0\b 29.301 [Reserved]\
29.302 Application of State and local taxes to the Government.\

\f1\b0 (a) Generally, purchases and leases made by the Federal Government are immune from State and local taxation. Whether any specific purchase or lease is immune, how-ever, is a legal question requiring advice and assistance of the agency- designated counsel.\
(b) When it is economically feasible to do so, executive agencies shall take maximum advantage of all exemptions from State and local taxation that may be available. If appropriate, the contracting officer shall provide a \cf3 Standard Form 1094\cf4 , U.S. Tax Exemption Form (see \cf3 part 53\cf4 ), or other evidence listed in \cf3 29.305\cf4 (a) to establish that the purchase is being made by the Government.\

\f0\b 29.303 Application of State and local taxes to Government contractors and subcontractors.\

\f1\b0 (a) Prime contractors and subcontractors shall not normally be designated as agents of the Government for the purpose\
of claiming immunity from State or local sales or use taxes. Before any activity contends that a contractor is an agent of the Government, the matter shall be referred to the agency head for review. The referral shall include all pertinent data on which the contention is based, together with a thorough analysis of all relevant legal precedents.\
(b) When purchases are not made by the Government itself, but by a prime contractor or by a subcontractor under a prime contract, the right to an exemption of the transaction from a sales or use tax may not rest on the Government\'92s immunity from direct taxation by States and localities. It may rest instead on provisions of the particular State or local law involved, or, in some cases, the transaction may not in fact be expressly exempt from the tax. The Government\'92s interest shall be protected by using the procedures in \cf3 29.101\cf4 .\
(c) Frequently, property (including property acquired under the progress payments clause of fixed-price contracts or the Government property clause of cost-reimbursement contracts) owned by the Government is in the possession of a contractor or subcontractor. Situations may arise in which States or localities assert the right to tax Government property directly or to tax the contractor\'92s or subcontractor\'92s possession of, interest in, or use of that property. In such cases, the contracting officer shall seek review and advice from the agency-designated counsel on the appropriate course of action.\

\f0\b 29.304 Matters requiring special consideration.\

\f1\b0 The imposition of State and local taxes may result in special contract considerations including the following:\
(a) With coordination of the agency-designated counsel, a contract may (1) state that the contract price includes or excludes a specified tax or (2) require that the contractor take certain actions with regard to payment, nonpayment, refund, protest, or other treatment of a specified tax. Such special treatment may be appropriate when there is doubt as to the applicability or allocability of the tax, or when the applicability of the tax is being litigated.\
(b) The applicability of State and local taxes to purchases by the Federal Government may depend on the place and terms of delivery. When the contract price will be substantial, alternative places and terms of delivery should be considered in light of possible tax consequences.\
(c) Indefinite-delivery contracts for equipment rental may require the contractor to furnish equipment in any of the States. Since leased equipment remains the contractor\'92s property, States and local governments impose a wide variety of property, use, or other taxes on equipment leased to the Government. The amount of these taxes can vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. See \cf3 29.401-1 \cf4 for the prescription of the contract clause to be included in contracts when delivery points are not known at time of contracting.\
(d) The North Carolina State and local sales and use tax. (1) The North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Act authorizes counties and incorporated cities and towns to obtain each year from the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of North Carolina a refund of sales and use taxes indirectly paid on building materials, supplies, fixtures, and equipment that become a part of or are annexed to any building or structure erected, altered, or repaired for such counties and incorporated cities and towns in North Carolina. In 
\f2\i United States 
\f1\i0 v. 
\f2\i Clayton
\f1\i0 , 250 F. Supp. 827 (1965), it was held that the United States is entitled to the benefit of the refund, but must follow the refund procedure of the Act and the regulations to recover what it is due.\

\fs20 (2) The Act provides that, to receive the refund, claimants must file, within 6 months after the claimant\'92s fiscal year closes, a written request substantiated by such records, receipts, and information as the Commissioner of Revenue may require. No refund will be made on an application not filed within the time allowed and in such manner as the Commissioner may require. The requirements of the Commissioner are set forth in regulations that provide that, to substantiate a refund claim for sales or use taxes paid on purchases of building materials, supplies, fixtures, or equipment by a contractor, the Government must secure from the contractor certified statements setting forth the cost of the property purchased from each vendor and the amount of sales or use taxes paid. In the event the contractor makes several purchases from the same vendor, the certified statement must indicate the invoice numbers, the inclusive dates of the invoices, the total amount of the invoices, and the sales and use taxes paid. The statement must also include the cost of any tangible personal property withdrawn from the contractor\'92s warehouse stock and the amount of sales or use tax paid by the contractor. Similar certified statements by subcontractors must be obtained by the general contractor and furnished to the claimant. Any local sales or use taxes included in the contractor\'92s statement must be shown separately from the State sales or use taxes.\
(3) The clause prescribed at \cf3 29.401-2 \cf4 requires contractors to submit to contracting officers by November 30 of each year a certified statement disclosing North Carolina State and local sales and use taxes paid during the 12-month period that ended the preceding September 30. The contracting officer shall ensure that contractors comply with this requirement and shall obtain the annual refund to which the Government may be entitled. The application for refund must be filed each year before March 31 and in the manner and form required by the Commissioner of Revenue. Copies of the form may be obtained from the-\
State of North Carolina, Department of Revenue, PO Box 25000 Raleigh, North Carolina 27640.\

\f0\b 29.305 State and local tax exemptions.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Evidence of exemption. 
\f1\i0 Evidence needed to establish exemption from State or local taxes depends on the grounds for the exemption claimed, the parties to the transaction, and the requirements of the taxing jurisdiction. Such evidence may include the following:\
(1) A copy of the contract or relevant portion.\
(2) Copies of purchase orders, shipping documents, credit-card-imprinted sales slips, paid or acknowledged invoices, or similar documents that identify an agency or instrumentality of the United States as the buyer.\
(3) A U.S. Tax Exemption Form (\cf3 SF 1094\cf4 ).\
(4) A State or local form indicating that the supplies or services are for the exclusive use of the United States. (5) Any other State or locally required document for establishing general or specific exemption.\
(6) Shipping documents indicating that shipments are in interstate or foreign commerce.\
(b) 
\f2\i Furnishing proof of exemption
\f1\i0 . If a reasonable basis to sustain a claimed exemption exists, the seller will be furnished evidence of exemption, as follows:\
(1) Under a contract containing the clause at \cf3 52.229-3\cf4 , Federal, State, and Local Taxes, or at \cf3 52.229-4\cf4 , Federal, State, and Local Taxes (State and Local Adjustments), in accordance with the terms of those clauses.\
(2) Under a cost-reimbursement contract, if requested by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer or at the discretion of the contracting officer.\
(3) Under a contract or purchase order that contains no tax provision, if-\
(i) Requested by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer or at the discretion of the contracting officer;\
and\
(ii) Either the contract price does not include the tax or, if the transaction or property is tax exempt, the contractor\
consents to a reduction in the contract price.\

\f0\b 29.401-4 New Mexico gross receipts and compensating tax.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Definition
\f1\i0 .\

\f2\i Services
\f1\i0 , as used in this subsection, is as defined in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act of the State of New Mexico, Sec 7-9-3(k) NM SA1978, and means all activities engaged in for other persons for a consideration, which activities involve predominately the performance of a service as distinguished from selling or leasing property. "Services" includes activities performed by a person for its members or shareholders. In determining what is a service, the intended use, principal objective or ultimate objective of the contracting parties shall not be controlling. "Services" also includes construction activities and all tangible personal property that will become an ingredient or component part of a construction project. Such tangible personal property retains its character as tangible personal property until it is installed as an ingredient or component part of a construction project in New Mexico. However, sales of tangible personal property that will become an ingredient\
or component part of a construction project to persons engaged in the construction business are sales of tangible personal property.\
(b) 
\f2\i Contract clause
\f1\i0 . The contracting officer shall insert the clause at \cf3 52.229-10\cf4 , State of New Mexico Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax, in solicitations and contracts issued by the agencies identified in paragraph (c) of this subsection when all three of the following conditions exist:\
(1) The contractor will be performing a cost-reimbursement contract.\
(2) The contract directs or authorizes the contractor to acquire tangible personal property as a direct cost under a contract and title to such property passes directly to and vests in the United States upon delivery of the property by the vendor.\
(3) The contract will be for services to be performed in whole or in part within the State of New Mexico.\
(c) Participating agencies. (1) The agencies listed below have entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico\
to eliminate the double taxation of Government cost-reimbursement contracts when contractors and their subcontractors purchase tangible personal property to be used in performing services in whole or in part in the State of New Mexico and for which title to such property will pass to the United States upon delivery of the property to the contractor and its subcontractors by the vendor. Therefore, the clause applies only to solicitations and contracts issued by the-\
United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency;\
United States Department of Agriculture;\

\f1\b0 This part describes policies and procedures for applying the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) rules and regulations ( 48 CFR Chapter 99) to negotiated contracts and subcontracts. This part does not apply to sealed bid contracts or to any contract with a small business concern (see 48 CFR 9903.201-1(b) for these and other exemptions).\

\f0\b 30.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Affected CAS-covered contract or subcontract 
\f1\i0 means a contract or subcontract subject to Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rules and regulations for which a contractor or subcontractor-\
(1) Used one cost accounting practice to estimate costs and a changed cost accounting practice to accumulate and report costs under the contract or subcontract; or\
(2) Used a noncompliant practice for purposes of estimating or accumulating and reporting costs under the contract or subcontract.\

\f2\i Cognizant Federal agency official (CFAO) 
\f1\i0 means the contracting officer assigned by the cognizant Federal agency to administer the CAS.\

\f2\i Desirable change 
\f1\i0 means a compliant change to a contractor\'92s established or disclosed cost accounting practices that the CFAO finds is desirable and not detrimental to the Government and is, therefore, not subject to the no increased cost prohibition provisions of CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts affected by the change.\

\f2\i Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts 
\f1\i0 means-\
(1) Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts described at \cf3 16.202\cf4 , \cf3 16.203 \cf4 (except when price adjustments are based on\
actual costs of labor or material, described at \cf3 16.203-1\cf4 (a)(2)), and \cf3 16.207\cf4 ;\
(2) Fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts where the price is not adjusted based on actual costs incurred\
(\cf3 subpart 16.4\cf4 );\
(3) Orders issued under indefinite-delivery contracts and subcontracts where final payment is not based on actual costs\
incurred (\cf3 subpart 16.5\cf4 ); and\
(4) The fixed-hourly rate portion of time-and-materials and labor-hours contracts and subcontracts (\cf3 subpart 16.6\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts 
\f1\i0 means-\

(2) Cost-reimbursement contracts and subcontracts (\cf3 subpart 16.3\cf4 );\
(3) Incentive contracts and subcontracts where the price may be adjusted based on actual costs incurred (\cf3 subpart 16.4\cf4 ); (4) Orders issued under indefinite-delivery contracts and subcontracts where final payment is based on actual costs\
incurred (\cf3 subpart 16.5\cf4 ); and\
(5) The materials portion of time-and-materials contracts and subcontracts (\cf3 subpart 16.6\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Noncompliance 
\f1\i0 means a failure in estimating, accumulating, or reporting costs to- (1) Comply with applicable CAS; or\
(2) Consistently follow disclosed or established cost accounting practices.\

\f2\i Required change 
\f1\i0 means-\
(1) A change in cost accounting practice that a contractor is required to make in order to comply with applicable\
Standards, modifications or interpretations thereto, that subsequently becomes applicable to an existing CAS-covered contract or subcontract due to the receipt of another CAS-covered contract or subcontract; or\
(2) A prospective change to a disclosed or established cost accounting practice when the CFAO determines that the former practice was in compliance with applicable CAS and the change is necessary for the contractor to remain in compliance.\

\f2\i Unilateral change 
\f1\i0 means a change in cost accounting practice from one compliant practice to another compliant practice that a contractor with a CAS-covered contract(s) or subcontract(s) elects to make that has not been deemed a desirable change by the CFAO and for which the Government will pay no aggregate increased costs.\

The contracting officer must then ensure that the offeror has made the required solicitation certifications and that required Disclosure Statements are submitted. (Also see 48 CFR 9903.201-3 and 9903.202).\
(b) The contracting officer shall not award a CAS-covered contract until the cognizant Federal agency official (CFAO) has made a written determination that a required Disclosure Statement is adequate unless, in order to protect the Government's interest, the agency head, on a nondelegable basis, authorizes award without obtaining submission of the required Disclosure Statement (see 48 CFR 9903.202-2). In this event, the contractor shall submit the required Disclosure Statement and the CFAO shall make a determination of adequacy as soon as possible after the award.\

(i) Conduct a review of the Disclosure Statement to ascertain whether it is current, accurate, and complete; and (ii) Report the results to the CFAO.\
(2) The CFAO shall determine if the Disclosure Statement adequately describes the contractor\'92s cost accounting practices. Also, the CFAO shall-\
(i) If the Disclosure Statement is adequate, notify the contractor in writing, and provide a copy to the auditor with a copy to the contracting officer if the proposal triggers submission of a Disclosure Statement. The notice of adequacy shall state that-\
(A) The disclosed practices are adequately described and the CFAO currently is not aware of any additional practices that should be disclosed;\
(B) The notice is not a determination that all cost accounting practices were disclosed; and\
(C) The contractor shall not consider a disclosed practice, by virtue of such disclosure, an approved practice for estimating proposals or accumulating and reporting contract and subcontract cost data; or\
(ii) If the Disclosure Statement is inadequate, notify the contractor of the inadequacies and request a revised Disclosure Statement.\
(3) Generally, the CFAO should furnish the contractor notification of adequacy or inadequacy within 30 days after the CFAO receives the Disclosure Statement.\
(b) Compliance determination. (1) After the notification of adequacy, the auditor shall-\
(i) Conduct a detailed compliance review to ascertain whether or not the disclosed practices comply with CAS and\
\cf3 part 31\cf4 , as applicable; and\
(ii) Advise the CFAO of the results.\
(2) The CFAO shall make a determination of compliance or take action regarding a report of alleged noncompliance in accordance with \cf3 30.605\cf4 (b). Such action should include requesting a revised Disclosure Statement that corrects the CAS noncompliance. Noncompliances with \cf3 part 31 \cf4 shall be processed separately.\

The CFAO shall make all CAS-related required determinations and findings (see \cf3 subpart 1.7\cf4 ) for all CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts, including-\
(1) Whether a change in cost accounting practice or noncompliance has occurred; and\
(2) If a change in cost accounting practice or noncompliance has occurred, how any resulting cost impacts are resolved. (b) Within 30 days after the award of any new contract subject to CAS, the contracting officer making the award shall\
request the CFAO to perform administration for CAS matters (see \cf3 subpart 42.2\cf4 ). For subcontract awards, the contractor awarding the subcontract must follow the procedures at \cf3 52.230-6\cf4 (l), (m), and (n).\
(c) In performing CAS administration, the CFAO shall request and consider the advice of the auditor as appropriate (see \cf3 1.602-2\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 30.602 Materiality.\

\f1\b0 (a) In determining materiality, the CFAO shall use the criteria in 48 CFR 9903.305. (b) A CFAO determination of materiality-\
(1) May be made before or after a general dollar magnitude proposal has been submitted, depending on the particular facts and circumstances; and\
(2) Shall be based on adequate documentation.\
(c) When the CFAO determines the cost impact is immaterial, the CFAO shall-\
(1) Make no contract adjustments and conclude the cost impact process; (2) Document the rationale for the determination; and\
(3) In the case of noncompliance issues, inform the contractor that-\
(i) The noncompliance should be corrected; and\
(ii) If the noncompliance is not corrected, the Government reserves the right to make appropriate contract adjustments should the cost impact become material in the future.\
(d) For required, unilateral, and desirable changes, and CAS noncompliances, when the amount involved is material, the CFAO shall follow the applicable provisions in \cf3 30.603\cf4 , \cf3 30.604\cf4 , \cf3 30.605\cf4 , and \cf3 30.606\cf4 .\

\f0\b 30.603 Changes to disclosed or established cost accounting practices.\
30.603-1 Required changes.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . Offerors shall state whether or not the award of a contract would require a change to an established cost accounting practice affecting existing contracts and subcontracts (see \cf3 52.230-1\cf4 ). The contracting officer shall notify the CFAO if the offeror states that a change in cost accounting practice would be required.\
(b) 
\f2\i CFAO responsibilities
\f1\i0 . Prior to making an equitable adjustment under the applicable paragraph (s) that address a required change at \cf3 52.230-2\cf4 , Cost Accounting Standards; \cf3 52.230-3\cf4 , Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices; or \cf3 52.230-5\cf4 , Cost Accounting Standards-Educational Institution, the CFAO shall determine that-\
(1) The cost accounting practice change is required to comply with a CAS, or a modification or interpretation thereof, that subsequently became applicable to one or more contracts or subcontracts; or\
(2) The former cost accounting practice was in compliance with applicable CAS and the change is necessary to remain in compliance.\
(c) Notice and proposal preparation. (1) When the award of a contract would require a change to an established cost accounting practice, the provision at \cf3 52.230-7\cf4 , Proposal Disclosure-Cost Accounting Practice Changes, requires the offeror to-\
(i) Prepare the contract pricing proposal in response to the solicitation using the changed cost accounting practice for the period of performance for which the practice will be used; and\
(ii) Submit a description of the changed cost accounting practice to the contracting officer and the CFAO as pricing support for the proposal.\
(2) When a change is required to remain in compliance (for reasons other than a contract award) or to comply with a new or modified standard, the clause at \cf3 52.230-6\cf4 , Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, requires the contractor to-\

\fs20 (i) Submit a description of the change to the CFAO not less than 60 days (or other mutually agreeable date) before implementation of the change; and\
(ii) Submit rationale to support any contractor written statement that the cost impact of the change is immaterial. (d) Equitable adjustments for new or modified standards. (1) Required changes made to comply with new or modified\
standards may require equitable adjustments, but only to those contracts awarded before the effective date of the new or modified standard (see \cf3 52.230-2\cf4 , \cf3 52.230-3\cf4 , or \cf3 52.230-5\cf4 ).\
(2) When a contractor elects to implement a required change to comply with a new or modified standard prior to the applicability date of the standard, the CFAO shall administer the change as a unilateral change (see \cf3 30.603-2\cf4 ). Contractors shall not receive an equitable adjustment that will result in increased costs in the aggregate to the Government prior to the applicability date unless the CFAO determines that the unilateral change is a desirable change.\

\f0\b 30.603-2 Unilateral and desirable changes.\

\f1\b0 (a) Unilateral changes. (1) The contractor may unilaterally change its disclosed or established cost accounting practices, but the Government shall not pay any increased cost, in the aggregate, as a result of the unilateral change.\
(2) Prior to making any contract price or cost adjustments under the applicable paragraph (s) addressing a unilateral change at \cf3 52.230-2\cf4 , \cf3 52.230-3\cf4 , or \cf3 52.230-5\cf4 , the CFAO shall determine that-\
(i) The contemplated contract price or cost adjustments will protect the Government from the payment of the estimated increased costs, in the aggregate; and\
(ii) The net effect of the contemplated adjustments will not result in the recovery of more than the increased costs to the Government, in the aggregate.\
(b) Desirable changes. (1) Prior to taking action under the applicable paragraph (s) addressing a desirable change at \cf3 52.230-2\cf4 , \cf3 52.230-3\cf4 , or \cf3 52.230-5\cf4 , the CFAO shall determine the change is a desirable change and not detrimental to the interests of the Government.\
(2) Until the CFAO has determined a change to a cost accounting practice is a desirable change, the change is a unilateral change.\
(3) Some factors to consider in determining if a change is desirable include, but are not limited to, whether-\
(i) The contractor must change the cost accounting practices it uses for Government contract and subcontract costing\
purposes to remain in compliance with the provisions of \cf3 part 31\cf4 ;\
(ii) The contractor is initiating management actions directly associated with the change that will result in cost\
savings for segments with CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts over a period for which forward pricing rates are developed or 5 years, whichever is shorter, and the cost savings are reflected in the forward pricing rates; and\
(iii) Funds are available if the determination would necessitate an upward adjustment of contract cost or price. (c) Notice and proposal preparation. (1) When a contractor makes a unilateral change, the clause at \cf3 52.230-6\cf4 ,\
Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, requires the contractor to-\
(i) Submit a description of the change to the CFAO not less than 60 days (or other mutually agreeable date) before\
implementation of the change; and\
(ii) Submit rationale to support any contractor written statement that the cost impact of the change is immaterial.\
(2) If a contractor implements the change in cost accounting practice without submitting the notice as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection, the CFAO may determine the change a failure to follow a cost accounting practice consistently and process it as a noncompliance in accordance with \cf3 30.605\cf4 .\
(d) Retroactive changes. (1) If a contractor requests that a unilateral change be retroactive, the contractor shall submit supporting rationale.\
(2) The CFAO shall promptly evaluate the contractor\'92s request and shall, as soon as practical, notify the contractor in writing whether the request is or is not approved.\
(3) The CFAO shall not approve a date for the retroactive change that is before the beginning of the contractor\'92s fiscal year in which the request is made.\
(e) 
\f2\i Contractor accounting changes due to external restructuring activities
\f1\i0 . The requirements for contract price and\
cost adjustments do not apply to compliant cost accounting practice changes that are directly associated with external restructuring activities that are subject to and meet the requirements of \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3761\cf4 . However, the disclosure requirements in \cf3 52.230-6\cf4 (b) shall be followed.\

\f2\i Procedures
\f1\i0 . Upon receipt of the contractor\'92s notification and description of the change in cost accounting practice, the CFAO should review the proposed change concurrently for adequacy and compliance. The CFAO shall-\
(1) If the description of the change is both adequate and compliant, notify the contractor in writing and-\
(i) For required or unilateral changes (except those requested to be determined desirable changes), request the\
contractor submit a general dollar magnitude (GDM) proposal by a specified date, unless the CFAO determines the cost impact is immaterial; or\
(ii) For unilateral changes that the contractor requests to be determined desirable changes, inform the contractor that the request shall include supporting rationale and-\
(A) For any request based on the criteria in \cf3 30.603-2\cf4 (b)(3)(ii), the data necessary to demonstrate the required cost savings; or\
(B) For any request other than those based on the criteria in \cf3 30.603-2\cf4 (b)(3)(ii), a GDM proposal and any other data necessary for the CFAO to determine if the change is a desirable change;\
(2) If the description of the change is inadequate, request a revised description of the new cost accounting practice; and\
(3) If the disclosed practice is noncompliant, notify the contractor in writing that, if implemented, the CFAO will determine the cost accounting practice to be noncompliant and process it accordingly.\
(c) Evaluating requests for desirable changes. (1) When a contractor requests a unilateral change be determined a desirable change, the CFAO shall promptly evaluate the contractor\'92s request and, as soon as practical, notify the contractor in writing whether the change is a desirable change or the request is denied.\
(2) If the CFAO determines the change is a desirable change, the CFAO shall negotiate any cost or price adjustments that may be needed to resolve the cost impact (see \cf3 30.606\cf4 ).\
(3) If the request is denied, the change is a unilateral change and shall be processed accordingly. (d) 
\f2\i General dollar magnitude proposal. 
\f1\i0 The GDM proposal-\
(1) Provides information to the CFAO on the estimated overall impact of a change in cost accounting practice on affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts that were awarded based on the previous cost accounting practice;\
(2) Assists the CFAO in determining whether individual contract price or cost adjustments are required; and\
(3) The contractor may submit a detailed cost-impact (DCI) proposal in lieu of a GDM proposal provided the DCI proposal is in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.\
(e) 
\f2\i General dollar magnitude proposal content. 
\f1\i0 The GDM proposal-\
(1) Shall calculate the cost impact in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section;\
(2) May use one or more of the following methods to determine the increase or decrease in cost accumulations:\
(i) A representative sample of affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts.\
(ii) The change in indirect rates multiplied by the total estimated base computed for each of the following groups:\
(A) Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.\
(B) Flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts.\
(iii) Any other method that provides a reasonable approximation of the total increase or decrease in cost\
accumulations for all affected fixed-price and flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts.\
(3) May be in any format acceptable to the CFAO but, as a minimum, shall include the following data:\
(i) A general dollar magnitude estimate of the total increase or decrease in cost accumulations by Executive agency, including any impact the change may have on contract and subcontract incentives, fees, and profits, for each of the following groups:\
(A) Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.\
(B) Flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts.\
(ii) For unilateral changes, the increased or decreased costs to the Government for each of the following groups:\
(A) Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.\
(B) Flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts; and\
(4) When requested by the CFAO, shall identify all affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts.\
(f) 
\f2\i General dollar magnitude proposal evaluation. 
\f1\i0 The CFAO shall promptly evaluate the GDM proposal. If the cost impact is immaterial, the CFAO shall notify the contractor in writing and conclude the cost-impact process with no contract adjustments. Otherwise, the CFAO shall-\
(1) Negotiate and resolve the cost impact (see \cf3 30.606\cf4 ). If necessary, the CFAO may request that the contractor submit a revised GDM proposal by a specified date with specific additional data needed to resolve the cost impact (
\f2\i e.g
\f1\i0 .
\f2\i , 
\f1\i0 an expanded sample of affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts or a revised method of computing the increase or decrease in cost accumulations); or\

\f2\i Detailed cost-impact proposal. 
\f1\i0 If the contractor is required to submit a DCI proposal, the CFAO shall promptly evaluate the DCI proposal and follow the procedures at \cf3 30.606 \cf4 to negotiate and resolve the cost impact. The DCI proposal-\
(1) Shall calculate the cost impact in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section;\
(2) Shall show the estimated increase or decrease in cost accumulations for each affected CAS-covered contract and subcontract unless the CFAO and contractor agree to-\
(i) Include only those affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts exceeding a specified amount; and\
(ii) Estimate the total increase or decrease in cost accumulations for all affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts, using the results in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section;\
(3) May be in any format acceptable to the CFAO but, as a minimum, shall include the requirements at paragraphs (e) (3)(i) and (ii) of this section; and\
(4) When requested by the CFAO, shall identify all affected contracts and subcontracts. (h) 
\f2\i Calculating cost impacts
\f1\i0 . The cost impact calculation shall-\
(1) Include all affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts regardless of their status (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 open or closed) or the fiscal year(s) in which the costs are incurred (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 whether or not the final indirect rates have been established);\
(2) Combine the cost impact for all affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts for all segments if the effect of a change results in costs flowing between those segments;\
(3) For unilateral changes-\
(i) Determine the increased or decreased cost to the Government for flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts as\
follows:\
(A) When the estimated cost to complete using the changed practice exceeds the estimated cost to complete using\
the current practice, the difference is increased cost to the Government.\
(B) When the estimated costs to complete using the changed practice is less than the estimated cost to complete\
using the current practice, the difference is decreased cost to the Government.\
(ii) Determine the increased or decreased cost to the Government for fixed-price contracts and subcontracts as\
follows:\
(A) When the estimated cost to complete using the changed practice is less than the estimated cost to complete\
using the current practice, the difference is increased cost to the Government.\
(B) When the estimated cost to complete using the changed practice exceeds the estimated cost to complete using\
the current practice, the difference is decreased cost to the Government.\
(iii) Calculate the total increase or decrease in contract and subcontract incentives, fees, and profits associated\
with the increased or decreased cost to the Government in accordance with 48 CFR 9903.306(c). The associated increase or decrease is based on the difference between the negotiated incentives, fees and profits and the amounts that would have been negotiated had the cost impact been known at the time the contracts and subcontracts were negotiated.\
(iv) Calculate the increased cost to the Government in the aggregate.\
(4) For required or desirable changes, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of the\
contract.\
(i) 
\f2\i Remedies. 
\f1\i0 If the contractor does not submit the accounting change description or the proposals required in paragraph\
(d) or (g) of this section within the specified time, or any extension granted by the CFAO, the CFAO shall-\
(1) Estimate the general dollar magnitude of the cost impact on affected CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts; and (2) Take one or both of the following actions:\
(i) Withhold an amount not to exceed 10 percent of each subsequent payment related to the contractor\'92s CAS- covered contracts (up to the estimated general dollar magnitude of the cost impact), until the contractor furnishes the required information.\
(ii) Issue a final decision in accordance with \cf3 33.211 \cf4 and unilaterally adjust the contract(s) by the estimated amount of the cost impact.\

(i) Inform the contractor in writing that-\
(A) The noncompliance should be corrected; and\
(B) If the noncompliance is not corrected, the Government reserves the right to make appropriate contract\
adjustments should the noncompliance become material in the future; and (ii) Conclude the cost-impact process with no contract adjustments.\
(c) Correcting noncompliances. (1) The clause at \cf3 52.230-6 \cf4 requires the contractor to submit a description of any cost accounting practice change needed to correct a noncompliance within 60 days after the earlier of-\

\f0\b 30.606 Resolving cost impacts.\

\f1\b0 (a) General. (1) The CFAO shall coordinate with the affected contracting officers before negotiating and resolving the cost impact when the estimated cost impact on any of their contracts is at least $100,000. However, the CFAO has the sole authority for negotiating and resolving the cost impact.\
(2) The CFAO may resolve a cost impact attributed to a change in cost accounting practice or a noncompliance by adjusting a single contract, several but not all contracts, all contracts, or any other suitable method.\
(3) In resolving the cost impact, the CFAO-\
(i) Shall not combine the cost impacts of any of the following:\
(A) A required change and a unilateral change. (B) A required change and a noncompliance. (C) A desirable change and a unilateral change. (D) A desirable change and a noncompliance.\
(ii) Shall not combine the cost impacts of any of the following unless all of the cost impacts are increased costs to Government:\
(A) One or more unilateral changes.\
(B) One or more noncompliances.\
(C) Unilateral changes and noncompliances; and\
(iii) May consider the cost impacts of a unilateral change affecting two or more segments to be a single change if- (A) The change affects the flow of costs between segments; or\
(B) Implements a common cost accounting practice for two or more segments.\
(4) For desirable changes, the CFAO should consider the estimated cost impact of associated management actions on contract costs in resolving the cost impact.\
(b) 
\f2\i Negotiations. 
\f1\i0 The CFAO shall-\
(1) Negotiate and resolve the cost impact on behalf of all Government agencies; and\
(2) At the conclusion of negotiations, prepare a negotiation memorandum and send copies to the auditor and affected\
contracting officers.\
(c) 
\f2\i Contract adjustments. 
\f1\i0 (1) The CFAO may adjust some or all contracts with a material cost impact, subject to the\
provisions in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(6) of this section.\
(2) In selecting the contract or contracts to be adjusted, the CFAO should assure, to the maximum extent practical and\
subject to the provisions in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(6) of this section, that the adjustments reflect a 
\f2\i pro rata 
\f1\i0 share of the cost impact based on the ratio of the cost impact of each Executive agency to the total cost impact.\
(3) For unilateral changes and noncompliances, the CFAO shall-\
(i) To the maximum extent practical, not adjust the price upward for fixed-price contracts;\

\fs20 (ii) If contract adjustments are made, preclude payment of aggregate increased costs by taking one or both of the following actions:\
(A) Reduce the contract price on fixed-price contracts.\
(B) Disallow costs on flexibly-priced contracts; and\
(iii) The CFAO may, in consultation with the affected contracting officers, increase or decrease individual\
contract prices, including contract cost ceilings or target costs on flexibly-priced contracts. In such cases, the CFAO shall limit any upward contract price adjustments on affected contracts to the amount of downward price adjustments to other affected contracts, 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 the aggregate price of all contracts affected by a unilateral change shall not be increased (48 CFR 9903.201-6(b)).\
(4) For noncompliances that involve estimating costs, the CFAO-\
(i) Shall, to the extent practical, not adjust the price upward for fixed-price contracts;\
(ii) Shall, if contract adjustments are made, preclude payment of aggregate increased costs by reducing the contract\
price on fixed-price contracts;\
(iii) May, in consultation with the affected contracting officers, increase or decrease individual contract prices,\
including costs ceilings or target costs on flexibly-priced contracts. In such cases, the CFAO shall limit any upward contract price adjustments to affected contracts to the amount of downward price adjustments to other affected contracts, 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 the aggregate price of all contracts affected by a noncompliance that involves estimating costs shall not be increased (48 CFR 9903.201-6(d));\
(iv) Shall require the contractor to correct the noncompliance, 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 ensure that compliant cost accounting practices will now be utilized to estimate proposed contract costs; and\
(v) Shall require the contractor to adjust any invoices that were paid based on noncompliant contract prices to reflect the adjusted contract prices, after any contract price adjustments are made to resolve the noncompliance.\
(5) For noncompliances that involve cost accumulation, the CFAO- (i) Shall require the contractor to-\
(A) Correct noncompliant contract cost accumulations in the contractor\'92s cost accounting records for affected contracts to reflect compliant contract cost accumulations; and\
(B) Adjust interim payment requests (public vouchers and/or progress payments) and final vouchers to reflect the difference between the costs paid using the noncompliant practice and the costs that should have been paid using the compliant practice; or\
(ii) Shall adjust contract prices. In adjusting contract prices, the CFAO shall preclude payment of aggregate increased costs by disallowing costs on flexibly-priced contracts.\
(A) The CFAO may, in consultation with the affected contracting officers, increase or decrease individual contract prices, including costs ceilings or target costs on flexibly-priced contracts. In such cases, the CFAO shall limit any upward contract price adjustments to affected contracts to the amount of downward price adjustments to other affected contracts, 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 the aggregate price of all contracts affected by a noncompliance that involves cost accumulation shall not be increased (48 CFR 9903.201-6(d)).\
(B) Shall require the contractor to-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Correct contract cost accumulations in the contractor\'92s cost accounting records to reflect the contract price\
adjustments; and\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Adjust interim payment requests (public vouchers and/or progress payments) and final vouchers to reflect\
the contract price adjustments.\
(6) When contract adjustments are made, the CFAO shall-\
(i) Execute the bilateral modifications if the CFAO and contractor agree on the amount of the cost impact and the adjustments (see \cf3 42.302\cf4 (a)(11)(iv)); or\
(ii) When the CFAO and contractor do not agree on the amount of the cost impact or the contract adjustments, issue a final decision in accordance with \cf3 33.211 \cf4 and unilaterally adjust the contract(s).\
(d) Alternate methods. (1) The CFAO may use an alternate method instead of adjusting contracts to resolve the cost impact, provided the Government will not pay more, in the aggregate, than would be paid if the CFAO did not use the alternate method and the contracting parties agree on the use of that alternate method.\
(2) The CFAO may not use an alternate method for contracts when application of the alternate method to contracts would result in-\
(i) An under recovery of monies by the Government (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 due to cost overruns); or\

\f0\b\fs20 30.607\
 
\f1\b0 (ii) Distortions of incentive provisions and relationships between target costs, ceiling costs, and actual costs for incentive type contracts.\
(3) When using an alternate method that excludes the costs from an indirect cost pool, the CFAO shall-\
(i) Apply such exclusion only to the determination of final indirect cost rates (see \cf3 42.705\cf4 ); and\
(ii) Adjust the exclusion to reflect the Government participation rate for flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts.\
For example, if there are aggregate increased costs to the Government of $100,000, and the indirect cost pool where the adjustment is to be effected has a Government participation rate of 50 percent for flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts, the contractor shall exclude $200,000 from the indirect cost pool ($100,000/50% = $200,000).\

\f0\b 30.607 Subcontract administration.\

\f1\b0 When a negotiated CAS price adjustment or a determination of noncompliance is required at the subcontract level, the CFAO for the subcontractor shall furnish a copy of the negotiation memorandum or the determination to the CFAO for the contractor of the next higher-tier subcontractor. The CFAO of the contractor or the next higher-tier subcontractor shall not change the determination of the CFAO for the lower-tier subcontractor. If the subcontractor refuses to submit a GDM or DCI proposal, remedies are made at the prime contractor level.\

 31.000 Scope of part.\

\f1\b0 This part contains cost principles and procedures for-\
(a) The pricing of contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to contracts and subcontracts whenever cost analysis is performed (see \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (c)); and\
(b) The determination, negotiation, or allowance of costs when required by a contract clause.\

\f0\b 31.001 Definitions.\

\f1\b0 As used in this part-\

\f2\i Accrued benefit cost method 
\f1\i0 means an actuarial cost method under which units of benefits are assigned to each cost accounting period and are valued as they accrue; 
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 based on the services performed by each employee in the period involved. The measure of normal cost under this method for each cost accounting period is the present value of the units of benefit deemed to be credited to employees for service in that period. The measure of the actuarial accrued liability at a plan\'92s inception date is the present value of the units of benefit credited to employees for service prior to that date. (This method is also known as the unit credit cost method without salary projection.).\

\f2\i Accumulating costs 
\f1\i0 means collecting cost data in an organized manner, such as through a system of accounts.\

\f2\i Actual cash value 
\f1\i0 means the cost of replacing damaged property with other property of like kind and quality in the physical condition of the property immediately before the damage.\

\f2\i Actual costs 
\f1\i0 means (except for \cf3 subpart 31.6\cf4 ) amounts determined on the basis of costs incurred, as distinguished from forecasted costs. Actual costs include standard costs properly adjusted for applicable variances.\

\f2\i Actuarial accrued liability 
\f1\i0 means pension cost attributable, under the actuarial cost method in use, to years prior to the current period considered by a particular actuarial valuation. As of such date, the actuarial accrued liability represents the excess of the present value of future benefits and administrative expenses over the present value of future normal costs for all plan participants and beneficiaries. The excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan is the unfunded actuarial liability. The excess of the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan over the actuarial accrued liability is an actuarial surplus and is treated as a negative unfunded actuarial liability.\

\f2\i Actuarial assumption 
\f1\i0 means an estimate of future conditions affecting pension cost; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 mortality rate, employee turnover, compensation levels, earnings on pension plan assets, and changes in values of pension plan assets.\

\f2\i Actuarial cost method 
\f1\i0 means a technique which uses actuarial assumptions to measure the present value of future pension benefits and pension plan administrative expenses, and that assigns the cost of such benefits and expenses to cost accounting periods. The actuarial cost method includes the asset valuation method used to determine the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan.\

\f2\i Actuarial gain and loss 
\f1\i0 means the effect on pension cost resulting from differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience.\

\f2\i Actuarial valuation 
\f1\i0 means the determination, as of a specified date, of the normal cost, actuarial accrued liability, actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan, and other relevant values for the pension plan.\

\f2\i Allocate 
\f1\i0 means to assign an item of cost, or a group of items of cost, to one or more cost objectives. This term includes both direct assignment of cost and the reassignment of a share from an indirect cost pool.\

\f2\i Compensated personal absence 
\f1\i0 means any absence from work for reasons such as illness, vacation, holidays, jury duty, military training, or personal activities for which an employer pays compensation directly to an employee in accordance with a plan or custom of the employer.\

\f2\i Compensation for personal services 
\f1\i0 means all remuneration paid currently or accrued, in whatever form and whether paid immediately or deferred, for services rendered by employees to the contractor.\

\f2\i Cost input 
\f1\i0 means the cost, except general and administrative (G&A) expenses, which for contract costing purposes is allocable to the production of goods and services during a cost accounting period.\

\f2\i Cost objective 
\f1\i0 means (except for \cf3 subpart 31.6\cf4 ) a function, organizational subdivision, contract, or other work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, products, jobs, capitalized projects, etc.\

\f2\i Deferred compensation 
\f1\i0 means an award made by an employer to compensate an employee in a future cost accounting period or periods for services rendered in one or more cost accounting periods before the date of the receipt of compensation by the employee. This definition shall not include the amount of year end accruals for salaries, wages, or bonuses that are to be paid within a reasonable period of time after the end of a cost accounting period.\

\f2\i Defined-benefit pension plan 
\f1\i0 means a pension plan in which the benefits to be paid, or the basis for determining such benefits, are established in advance and the contributions are intended to provide the stated benefits.\

\f2\i\fs20 Defined-contribution pension plan 
\f1\i0 means a pension plan in which the contributions to be made are established in advance and the benefits are determined thereby.\

\f2\i Directly associated cost 
\f1\i0 means any cost which is generated solely as a result of the incurrence of another cost, and which would not have been incurred had the other cost not been incurred.\

\f2\i Estimating costs 
\f1\i0 means the process of forecasting a future result in terms of cost, based upon information available at the time.\

\f2\i Expressly unallowable cost 
\f1\i0 means a particular item or type of cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, regulation, or contract, is specifically named and stated to be unallowable.\

\f2\i Final cost objective 
\f1\i0 means (except for \cf3 subparts 31.3 \cf4 and \cf3 31.6\cf4 ) a cost objective that has allocated to it both direct and indirect costs and, in the contractor\'92s accumulation system, is one of the final accumulation points.\

\f2\i Fiscal year 
\f1\i0 means the accounting period for which annual financial statements are regularly prepared, generally a period of 12 months, 52 weeks, or 53 weeks.\

\f2\i Home office 
\f1\i0 means an office responsible for directing or managing two or more, but not necessarily all, segments of an organization. It typically establishes policy for, and provides guidance to, the segments in their operations. It usually performs management, supervisory, or administrative functions, and may also perform service functions in support of the operations of the various segments. An organization which has intermediate levels, such as groups, may have several home offices which report to a common home office. An intermediate organization may be both a segment and a home office.\

\f2\i Immediate-gain actuarial cost method 
\f1\i0 means any of the several actuarial cost methods under which actuarial gains and losses are included as part of the unfunded actuarial liability of the pension plan, rather than as part of the normal cost of the plan.\

\f2\i Independent research and development (IR&D) cost 
\f1\i0 means the cost of effort which is neither sponsored by a grant, nor required in performing a contract, and which falls within any of the following four areas-\
(a) Basic research,\
(b) Applied research,\
(c) Development, and\
(d) Systems and other concept formulation studies.\

\f2\i Indirect cost pools 
\f1\i0 means (except for \cf3 subparts 31.3 \cf4 and \cf3 31.6\cf4 ) groupings of incurred costs identified with two or more cost\
objectives but not identified specifically with any final cost objective.\

\f2\i Insurance administration expenses 
\f1\i0 means the contractor\'92s costs of administering an insurance program; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 the costs of\
operating an insurance or risk-management department, processing claims, actuarial fees, and service fees paid to insurance companies, trustees, or technical consultants.\

\f2\i Intangible capital asset 
\f1\i0 means an asset that has no physical substance, has more than minimal value, and is expected to be held by an enterprise for continued use or possession beyond the current accounting period for the benefits it yields.\

\f2\i Job 
\f1\i0 means a homogeneous cluster of work tasks, the completion of which serves an enduring purpose for the organization. Taken as a whole, the collection of tasks, duties, and responsibilities constitutes the assignment for one or more individuals whose work is of the same nature and is performed at the same skill/responsibility level-as opposed to a position, which is\
a collection of tasks assigned to a specific individual. Within a job, there may be pay categories which are dependent on the degree of supervision required by the employee while performing assigned tasks which are performed by all persons with the same job.\

\f2\i Job class of employees 
\f1\i0 means employees performing in positions within the same job.\

\f2\i Labor cost at standard 
\f1\i0 means a preestablished measure of the labor element of cost, computed by multiplying labor-rate standard by labor-time standard.\

\f2\i Labor market 
\f1\i0 means a place where individuals exchange their labor for compensation. Labor markets are identified and defined by a combination of the following factors-\
(1) Geography,\
(2) Education and/or technical background required, (3) Experience required by the job,\
(4) Licensing or certification requirements,\
(5) Occupational membership, and\
(6) Industry.\

\f2\i Labor-rate standard

\f1\i0 means an inventory costing method under which an average unit cost is computed after each\
acquisition by adding the cost of the newly acquired units to the cost of the units of inventory on hand and dividing this figure by the new total number of units.\

\f2\i Nonqualified pension plan 
\f1\i0 means any pension plan other than a qualified pension plan as defined in this part.\

\f2\i Normal cost 
\f1\i0 means the annual cost attributable, under the actuarial cost method in use, to current and future years as of a particular valuation date excluding any payment in respect of an unfunded actuarial liability.\

\f2\i Original complement of low cost equipment 
\f1\i0 means a group of items acquired for the initial outfitting of a tangible capital asset or an operational unit, or a new addition to either. The items in the group individually cost less than the minimum amount established by the contractor for capitalization for the classes of assets acquired but in the aggregate they represent a material investment. The group, as a complement, is expected to be held for continued service beyond the current period. Initial outfitting of the unit is completed when the unit is ready and available for normal operations.\

\f2\i Pay-as-you-go cost method 
\f1\i0 means a method of recognizing pension cost only when benefits are paid to retired employees or their beneficiaries.\

\f2\i Pension plan 
\f1\i0 means a deferred compensation plan established and maintained by one or more employers to provide systematically for the payment of benefits to plan participants after their retirements, provided that the benefits are paid for life or are payable for life at the option of the employees. Additional benefits such as permanent and total disability and death payments, and survivorship payments to beneficiaries of deceased employees, may be an integral part of a pension plan.\

\f2\i Pension plan participant 
\f1\i0 means any employee or former employee of an employer or any member or former member of an employee organization, who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit from a pension plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization who have satisfied the plan\'92s participation requirements, or whose beneficiaries are receiving or may be eligible to receive any such benefit. A participant whose employment status with the employer has not been terminated is an active participant of the employer\'92s pension plan.\

\f2\i Profit center 
\f1\i0 means (except for \cf3 subparts 31.3 \cf4 and \cf3 31.6\cf4 ) the smallest organizationally independent segment of a company charged by management with profit and loss responsibilities.\

\f2\i Projected benefit cost method 
\f1\i0 means either-\
(1) Any of the several actuarial cost methods that distribute the estimated total cost of all of the employees\'92 prospective\
benefits over a period of years, usually their working careers; or\
(2) A modification of the accrued benefit cost method that considers projected compensation levels.\

\f2\i Proposal

\f1\i0 means a cost which represents the projected average loss under a self-insurance plan.\

\f2\i Service life 
\f1\i0 means the period of usefulness of a tangible capital asset (or group of assets) to its current owner. The period may be expressed in units of time or output. The estimated service life of a tangible capital asset (or group of assets) is a current forecast of its service life and is the period over which depreciation cost is to be assigned.\

\f2\i Spread-gain actuarial cost method 
\f1\i0 means any of the several projected benefit actuarial cost methods under which actuarial gains and losses are included as part of the current and future normal costs of the pension plan.\

\f2\i Standard cost 
\f1\i0 means any cost computed with the use of preestablished measures.\

\f2\i Tangible capital asset 
\f1\i0 means an asset that has physical substance, more than minimal value, and is expected to be held by an enterprise for continued use or possession beyond the current accounting period for the services it yields.\

\f2\i Termination of employment gain or loss 
\f1\i0 means an actuarial gain or loss resulting from the difference between the assumed and actual rates at which pension plan participants separate from employment for reasons other than retirement, disability, or death.\

\f2\i Variance

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 31.1 - Applicability\

\fs20 31.100 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart describes the applicability of the cost principles and procedures in succeeding subparts of this part to various types of contracts and subcontracts. It also describes the need for advance agreements.\

\f0\b 31.101 Objectives.\

\f1\b0 In recognition of differing organizational characteristics, the cost principles and procedures in the succeeding subparts are grouped basically by organizational type; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 commercial concerns and educational institutions. The overall objective is to provide that, to the extent practicable, all organizations of similar types doing similar work will follow the same cost principles and procedures. To achieve this uniformity, individual deviations concerning cost principles require advance approval of the agency head or designee. Class deviations for the civilian agencies require advance approval of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council. Class deviations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration require advance approval of the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer. Class deviations for the Department of Defense require advance approval of the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.\

\f0\b 31.102 Fixed-price contracts.\

\f1\b0 The applicable subparts of \cf3 part 31 \cf4 shall be used in the pricing of fixed-price contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to contracts and subcontracts whenever (a) cost analysis is performed, or (b)a fixed-price contract clause requires the determination or negotiation of costs. However, application of cost principles to fixed-price contracts and subcontracts shall not be construed as a requirement to negotiate agreements on individual elements of cost in arriving at agreement on the total price. The final price accepted by the parties reflects agreement only on the total price. Further, notwithstanding the mandatory use of cost principles, the objective will continue to be to negotiate prices that are fair and reasonable, cost and other factors considered.\

\f0\b 31.103 Contracts with commercial organizations.\

\f1\b0 This category includes all contracts and contract modifications for supplies, services, or experimental, developmental, or research work negotiated with organizations other than educational institutions (see \cf3 31.104\cf4 ), construction and architect- engineer contracts (see \cf3 31.105\cf4 ), State and local governments (see \cf3 31.107\cf4 ) and nonprofit organizations (see \cf3 31.108\cf4 ) on the basis of cost.\
(a) The cost principles and procedures in \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 and agency supplements shall be used in pricing negotiated supply, service, experimental, developmental, and research contracts and contract modifications with commercial organizations whenever cost analysis is performed as required by \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (c).\
(b) In addition, the contracting officer shall incorporate the cost principles and procedures in \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 and agency supplements by reference in contracts with commercial organizations as the basis for-\
(1) Determining reimbursable costs under-\
(i) Cost-reimbursement contracts and cost-reimbursement subcontracts under these contracts performed by\
commercial organizations and\
(ii) The cost-reimbursement portion of time-and-materials contracts except when material is priced on a basis other\
than at cost (see \cf3 16.601\cf4 (c)(3)); 31.1-4\

(5) Price redetermination of price redetermination contracts (see \cf3 16.205 \cf4 and \cf3 16.206\cf4 ); and\
(6) Pricing changes and other contract modifications.\

\f0\b 31.104 Contracts with educational institutions.\

\f1\b0 This category includes all contracts and contract modifications for research and development, training, and other work performed by educational institutions (defined as institutions of higher educations in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart A, and \cf3 20 U.S.C. 1001\cf4 ).\
(a) The contracting officer shall incorporate the cost principles and procedures in \cf3 subpart 31.3 \cf4 by reference in cost- reimbursement contracts with educational institutions as the basis for-\
(1) Determining reimbursable costs under the contracts and cost-reimbursement subcontracts thereunder performed by educational institutions;\
(2) Negotiating indirect cost rates; and\
(3) Settling costs of cost-reimbursement terminated contracts (see \cf3 subpart 49.3 \cf4 and \cf3 49.109-7\cf4 ).\
(b) The cost principles in this subpart are to be used as a guide in evaluating costs in connection with negotiating fixed-\
price contracts and termination settlements.\

\f0\b 31.105 Construction and architect-engineer contracts.\

\f1\b0 (a) This category includes all contracts and contract modifications negotiated on the basis of cost with organizations other than educational institutions (see \cf3 31.104\cf4 ), State and local governments (see \cf3 31.107\cf4 ), and nonprofit organizations except\
those exempted under OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, appendix VIII (see \cf3 31.108\cf4 ) for construction management or construction, alteration or repair of buildings, bridges, roads, or other kinds of real property. It also includes architect- engineer contracts related to construction projects. It does not include contracts for vessels, aircraft, or other kinds of personal property.\
(b) Except as otherwise provided in (d) of this section, the cost principles and procedures in \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 shall be used in the pricing of contracts and contract modifications in this category if cost analysis is performed as required by \cf3 15.404-1\cf4 (c).\
(c) In addition, the contracting officer shall incorporate the cost principles and procedures in \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 (as modified by (d) of this section by reference in contracts in this category as the basis for-\
(1) Determining reimbursable costs under cost-reimbursement contracts, including cost-reimbursement subcontracts thereunder;\
(2) Negotiating indirect cost rates;\
(3) Proposing, negotiating, or determining costs under terminated contracts; (4) Price revision of fixed-price incentive contracts; and\
(5) Pricing changes and other contract modifications.\
(d) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), the allowability of costs for construction and architect-engineer contracts shall be determined in accordance with \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 .\
(1) Because of widely varying factors such as the nature, size, duration, and location of the construction project, advance agreements as set forth in \cf3 31.109\cf4 , for such items as home office overhead, partners\'92 compensation, employment of consultants, and equipment usage costs, are particularly important in construction and architect-engineer contracts. When appropriate, they serve to express the parties\'92 understanding and avoid possible subsequent disputes or disallowances.\
(2) "Construction equipment," as used in this section, means equipment (including marine equipment) in sound workable condition, either owned or controlled by the contractor or the subcontractor at any tier, or obtained from a commercial rental source, and furnished for use under Government contracts.\
(i) Allowable ownership and operating costs shall be determined as follows:\
(A) Actual cost data shall be used when such data can be determined for both ownership and operations costs\
for each piece of equipment, or groups of similar serial or series equipment, from the contractor\'92s accounting records. When such costs cannot be so determined, the contracting agency may specify the use of a particular schedule of predetermined rates or any part thereof to determine ownership and operating costs of construction equipment (see subdivisions (d)(2)(i) (B) and (C) of this section). However, costs otherwise unallowable under this part shall not become allowable through the use of any schedule (see \cf3 31.109\cf4 (c)). For example, schedules need to be adjusted for Government contract costing purposes if they are based on replacement cost, include unallowable interest costs, or use improper cost of money rates or computations.\

\fs20 Contracting officers should review the computations and factors included within the specified schedule and ensure that unallowable or unacceptably computed factors are not allowed in cost submissions.\
(B) Predetermined schedules of construction equipment use rates (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 the Construction Equipment Ownership and Operating Expense Schedule, published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, industry sponsored construction equipment cost guides, or commercially published schedules of construction equipment use cost) provide average ownership and operating rates for construction equipment. The allowance for operating costs may include costs for such items as\
fuel, filters, oil, and grease; servicing, repairs, and maintenance; and tire wear and repair. Costs of labor, mobilization, demobilization, overhead, and profit are generally not reflected in schedules, and separate consideration may be necessary.\
(C) When a schedule of predetermined use rates for construction equipment is used to determine direct costs, all costs of equipment that are included in the cost allowances provided by the schedule shall be identified and eliminated from the contractor\'92s other direct and indirect costs charged to the contract. If the contractor\'92s accounting system provides for site or home office overhead allocations, all costs which are included in the equipment allowances may need to be included in any cost input base before computing the contractor\'92s overhead rate. In periods of suspension of work pursuant to a contract clause, the allowance for equipment ownership shall not exceed an amount for standby cost as determined by the schedule or contract provision.\
(ii) Reasonable costs of renting construction equipment are allowable (but see paragraph (C) of this subsection).\
(A) Costs, such as maintenance and minor or running repairs incident to operating such rented equipment, that are\
not included in the rental rate are allowable.\
(B) Costs incident to major repair and overhaul of rental equipment are unallowable.\
(C) The allowability of charges for construction equipment rented from any division, subsidiary, or organization\
under common control, will be determined in accordance with \cf3 31.205-36\cf4 (b)(3).\
(3) Costs incurred at the job site incident to performing the work, such as the cost of superintendence, timekeeping\
and clerical work, engineering, utility costs, supplies, material handling, restoration and cleanup, etc., are allowable as direct or indirect costs, provided the accounting practice used is in accordance with the contractor\'92s established and consistently followed cost accounting practices for all work.\
(4) Rental and any other costs, less any applicable credits incurred in acquiring the temporary use of land, structures, and facilities are allowable. Costs, less any applicable credits, incurred in constructing or fabricating structures and facilities of a temporary nature are allowable.\

31.107 Contracts with State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf3 subpart 31.6 \cf4 provides principles and standards for determining costs applicable to contracts with State, local,\
and federally recognized Indian tribal governments. They provide the basis for a uniform approach to the problem of determining costs and to promote efficiency and better relationships between State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments, and Federal Government entities. They apply to all programs that involve contracts with State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments, except contracts with-\
(1) Publicly financed educational institutions subject to \cf3 subpart 31.3\cf4 ; or\
(2) Publicly owned hospitals and other providers of medical care subject to requirements promulgated by the sponsoring Government agencies.\
(b) The Office of Management and Budget will approve any other exceptions in particular cases when adequate justification is presented.\

\f0\b 31.108 Contracts with nonprofit organizations.\

\f1\b0 Subpart \cf3 31.7 \cf4 provides principles and standards for determining costs applicable to contracts with nonprofit organizations other than educational institutions (see \cf3 subpart 31.3\cf4 ), State and local governments (see \cf3 subpart 31.6\cf4 ), and those nonprofit organizations exempted under the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, appendix VIII (see \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 for the cost principles applicable to nonprofit organizations exempt from the cost principles in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200).\

\f0\b 31.109 Advance agreements.\

\f1\b0 \cf3 31.2\cf4 , \cf3 31.3\cf4 , \cf3 31.6\cf4 , and \cf3 31.7 \cf4 of certain costs may be difficult to determine. To avoid possible subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness, unallocability or unallowability under the specific cost principles at \cf3 subparts 31.2\cf4 ,\
\cf3 31.3\cf4 , \cf3 31.6\cf4 , and \cf3 31.7\cf4 , contracting officers and contractors should seek advance agreement on the treatment of special or unusual costs and on statistical sampling methodologies at \cf3 31.201-6\cf4 (c). However, an advance agreement is not an absolute requirement and the absence of an advance agreement on any cost will not, in itself, affect the reasonableness, allocability or the allowability under the specific cost principles at \cf3 subparts 31.2\cf4 , \cf3 31.3\cf4 , \cf3 31.6\cf4 , and \cf3 31.7 \cf4 of that cost.\
(b) Advance agreements may be negotiated either before or during a contract but should be negotiated before incurrence of the costs involved. The agreements must be in writing, executed by both contracting parties, and incorporated into applicable current and future contracts. An advance agreement shall contain a statement of its applicability and duration.\
(c) The contracting officer is not authorized by this \cf3 31.109 \cf4 to agree to a treatment of costs inconsistent with this part. For example, an advance agreement may not provide that, notwithstanding \cf3 31.205-20\cf4 , interest is allowable.\
(d) Advance agreements may be negotiated with a particular contractor for a single contract, a group of contracts, or all the contracts of a contracting office, an agency, or several agencies.\
(e) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO), or other contracting officer established in \cf3 part 42\cf4 , shall negotiate advance agreements except that an advance agreement affecting only one contract, or class of contracts from a single contracting office, shall be negotiated by a contracting officer in the contracting office, or an ACO when delegated by the contracting officer. When the negotiation authority is delegated, the ACO shall coordinate the proposed agreement with the contracting officer before executing the advance agreement.\
(f) Before negotiating an advance agreement, the Government negotiator shall-\
(1) Determine if other contracting offices inside the agency or in other agencies have a significant unliquidated dollar\
balance in contracts with the same contractor;\
(2) Inform any such office or agency of the matters under consideration for negotiation; and\
(3) As appropriate, invite the office or agency and the responsible audit agency to participate in prenegotiation\
discussions and/or in the subsequent negotiations.\
(g) Upon completion of the negotiation, the sponsor shall prepare and distribute to other interested agencies and offices,\
including the audit agency, copies of the executed agreement and a memorandum providing the information specified in \cf3 15.406-3\cf4 , as applicable.\
(h) Examples for which advance agreements may be particularly important are-\
(1) Compensation for personal services, including but not limited to allowances for off-site pay, incentive pay, location\
allowances, hardship pay, cost of living differential, and termination of defined benefit pension plans; (2) Use charges for fully depreciated assets;\
(3) Deferred maintenance costs;\
(4) Precontract costs;\
(5) Independent research and development and bid and proposal costs;\
(6) Royalties and other costs for use of patents;\
(7) Selling and distribution costs;\
(8) Travel and relocation costs, as related to special or mass personnel movements, as related to travel via contractor-\
owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft; or as related to maximum per diem rates; (9) Costs of idle facilities and idle capacity;\
(10) Severance pay to employees on support service contracts;\
(11) Plant reconversion;\
(12) Professional services (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 legal, accounting, and engineering);\
(13) General and administrative costs (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 corporate, division, or branch allocations) attributable to the general management, supervision, and conduct of the contractor\'92s business as a whole. These costs are particularly significant in construction, job-site, architect-engineer, facilities, and Government-owned contractor operated (GOCO) plant contracts (see \cf3 31.203\cf4 (h));\
(14) Costs of construction plant and equipment (see \cf3 31.105\cf4 (d)); (15) Costs of public relations and advertising; and\

\f0\b 31.110 Indirect cost rate certification and penalties on unallowable costs.\

\fs20 31.201 General.\
31.201-1 Composition of total cost.\

\f1\b0 (a) The total cost, including standard costs properly adjusted for applicable variances, of a contract is the sum of the\
direct and indirect costs allocable to the contract, incurred or to be incurred, plus any allocable cost of money pursuant to \cf3 31.205-10\cf4 , less any allocable credits. In ascertaining what constitutes a cost, any generally accepted method of determining or estimating costs that is equitable and is consistently applied may be used.\
(b) While the total cost of a contract includes all costs properly allocable to the contract, the allowable costs to the Government are limited to those allocable costs which are allowable pursuant to \cf3 part 31 \cf4 and applicable agency supplements.\

\f0\b 31.201-2 Determining allowability.\

\f1\b0 (a) A cost is allowable only when the cost complies with all of the following requirements:\
(1) Reasonableness.\
(2) Allocability.\
(3) Standards promulgated by the CAS Board, if applicable, otherwise, generally accepted accounting principles and\
practices appropriate to the circumstances.\
(4) Terms of the contract.\
(5) Any limitations set forth in this subpart.\
(b) Certain cost principles in this subpart incorporate the measurement, assignment, and allocability rules of selected CAS and limit the allowability of costs to the amounts determined using the criteria in those selected standards. Only those CAS\
or portions of standards specifically made applicable by the cost principles in this subpart are mandatory unless the contract is CAS-covered (see \cf3 part 30\cf4 ). Business units that are not otherwise subject to these standards under a CAS clause are subject to the selected standards only for the purpose of determining allowability of costs on Government contracts. Including\
the selected standards in the cost principles does not subject the business unit to any other CAS rules and regulations. The applicability of the CAS rules and regulations is determined by the CAS clause, if any, in the contract and the requirements of the standards themselves.\
(c) When contractor accounting practices are inconsistent with this \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 , costs resulting from such inconsistent practices in excess of the amount that would have resulted from using practices consistent with this subpart are unallowable. (d) A contractor is responsible for accounting for costs appropriately and for maintaining records, including supporting\
documentation, adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with applicable cost principles in this subpart and agency supplements. The contracting officer may disallow all or part of a claimed cost that is inadequately supported.\

\f0\b 31.201-3 Determining reasonableness.\

\f1\b0 (a) A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent\
person in the conduct of competitive business. Reasonableness of specific costs must be examined with particular care in connection with firms or their separate divisions that may not be subject to effective competitive restraints. No presumption of reasonableness shall be attached to the incurrence of costs by a contractor. If an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of a specific cost by the contracting officer or the contracting officer\'92s representative, the burden of proof shall be upon the contractor to establish that such cost is reasonable.\
(b) What is reasonable depends upon a variety of considerations and circumstances, including-\
(1) Whether it is the type of cost generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor\'92s\
business or the contract performance;\
(2) Generally accepted sound business practices, arm\'92s-length bargaining, and Federal and State laws and regulations; (3) The contractor\'92s responsibilities to the Government, other customers, the owners of the business, employees, and\
the public at large; and\
(4) Any significant deviations from the contractor\'92s established practices.\

\f0\b 31.201-4 Determining allocability.\

\f1\b0 A cost is allocable if it is assignable or chargeable to one or more cost objectives on the basis of relative benefits received or other equitable relationship. Subject to the foregoing, a cost is allocable to a Government contract if it-\

\fs20 (a) Is incurred specifically for the contract;\
(b) Benefits both the contract and other work, and can be distributed to them in reasonable proportion to the benefits received; or\
(c) Is necessary to the overall operation of the business, although a direct relationship to any particular cost objective cannot be shown.\

\f0\b 31.201-5 Credits.\

\f1\b0 The applicable portion of any income, rebate, allowance, or other credit relating to any allowable cost and received by or accruing to the contractor shall be credited to the Government either as a cost reduction or by cash refund. See \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 (j)(3) for rules governing refund or credit to the Government associated with pension adjustments and asset reversions.\

\f0\b 31.201-6 Accounting for unallowable costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) Costs that are expressly unallowable or mutually agreed to be unallowable, including mutually agreed to be unallowable directly associated costs, shall be identified and excluded from any billing, claim, or proposal applicable to a Government contract. A directly associated cost is any cost that is generated solely as a result of incurring another cost, and that would not have been incurred had the other cost not been incurred. When an unallowable cost is incurred, its directly associated costs are also unallowable.\
(b) Costs that specifically become designated as unallowable or as unallowable directly associated costs of unallowable costs as a result of a written decision furnished by a contracting officer shall be identified if included in or used in computing any billing, claim, or proposal applicable to a Government contract. This identification requirement applies also to any costs incurred for the same purpose under like circumstances as the costs specifically identified as unallowable under either this paragraph or paragraph (a) of this subsection.\
(c) (1) The practices for accounting for and presentation of unallowable costs must be those described in 48 CFR 9904.405, Accounting for Unallowable Costs.\
(2) Statistical sampling is an acceptable practice for contractors to follow in accounting for and presenting unallowable costs provided the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this subsection are met:\
(i) The statistical sampling results in an unbiased sample that is a reasonable representation of the sampling universe.\
(ii) Any large dollar value or high risk transaction is separately reviewed for unallowable costs and excluded from the sampling process.\
(iii) The statistical sampling permits audit verification.\
(3) For any indirect cost in the selected sample that is subject to the penalty provisions at \cf3 42.709\cf4 , the amount projected\
to the sampling universe from that sampled cost is also subject to the same penalty provisions.\
(4) Use of statistical sampling methods for identifying and segregating unallowable costs should be the subject of\
an advance agreement under the provisions of \cf3 31.109 \cf4 between the contractor and the cognizant administrative contracting officer or Federal official. The advance agreement should specify the basic characteristics of the sampling process. The cognizant administrative contracting officer or Federal official shall request input from the cognizant auditor before entering into any such agreements.\
(5) In the absence of an advance agreement, if an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of the statistical sampling methods by the contracting officer or the contracting officer\'92s representative, the burden of proof shall be on the contractor to establish that such a method meets the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection.\
(d) If a directly associated cost is included in a cost pool that is allocated over a base that includes the unallowable cost with which it is associated, the directly associated cost shall remain in the cost pool. Since the unallowable costs will attract their allocable share of costs from the cost pool, no further action is required to assure disallowance of the directly associated costs. In all other cases, the directly associated costs, if material in amount, must be purged from the cost pool as unallowable costs.\
(e) (1) In determining the materiality of a directly associated cost, consideration should be given to the significance of- (i) The actual dollar amount,\
(ii) The cumulative effect of all directly associated costs in a cost pool, and\
(iii) The ultimate effect on the cost of Government contracts.\
(2) Salary expenses of employees who participate in activities that generate unallowable costs shall be treated\
as directly associated costs to the extent of the time spent on the proscribed activity, provided the costs are material in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this subsection (except when such salary expenses are, themselves, unallowable). The time spent in proscribed activities should be compared to total time spent on company activities to determine if the costs are\

Time spent by employees outside the normal working hours should not be considered except when it is evident that an employee engages so frequently in company activities during periods outside normal working hours as to indicate that such activities are a part of the employee\'92s regular duties.\
(3) When a selected item of cost under \cf3 31.205 \cf4 provides that directly associated costs be unallowable, such directly associated costs are unallowable only if determined to be material in amount in accordance with the criteria provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this subsection, except in those situations where allowance of any of the directly associated costs involved would be considered to be contrary to public policy.\

\f0\b 31.201-7 Construction and architect-engineer contracts.\

\f1\b0 Specific principles and procedures for evaluating and determining costs in connection with contracts and subcontracts for construction, and architect-engineer contracts related to construction projects, are in \cf3 31.105\cf4 . The applicability of these principles and procedures is set forth in \cf3 31.000 \cf4 and \cf3 31.100\cf4 .\

\f0\b 31.202 Direct costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) No final cost objective shall have allocated to it as a direct cost any cost, if other costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances have been included in any indirect cost pool to be allocated to that or any other final cost objective. Direct costs of the contract shall be charged directly to the contract. All costs specifically identified with other final cost objectives of the contractor are direct costs of those cost objectives and are not to be charged to the contract directly or indirectly.\
(b) For reasons of practicality, the contractor may treat any direct cost of a minor dollar amount as an indirect cost if the accounting treatment-\
(1) Is consistently applied to all final cost objectives; and\
(2) Produces substantially the same results as treating the cost as a direct cost.\

\f0\b 31.203 Indirect costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) For contracts subject to full CAS coverage, allocation of indirect costs shall be based on the applicable provisions. For all other contracts, the applicable CAS provisions in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section apply.\
(b) After direct costs have been determined and charged directly to the contract or other work, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to intermediate or two or more final cost objectives. No final cost objective shall have allocated to it as an indirect cost any cost, if other costs incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, have been included as a direct cost of that or any other final cost objective.\
(c) The contractor shall accumulate indirect costs by logical cost groupings with due consideration of the reasons for incurring such costs. The contractor shall determine each grouping so as to permit use of an allocation base that is common to all cost objectives to which the grouping is to be allocated. The base selected shall allocate the grouping on the basis of the benefits accruing to intermediate and final cost objectives. When substantially the same results can be achieved through less precise methods, the number and composition of cost groupings should be governed by practical considerations and should not unduly complicate the allocation.\
(d) Once an appropriate base for allocating indirect costs has been accepted, the contractor shall not fragment the base by removing individual elements. All items properly includable in an indirect cost base shall bear a pro rata share of indirect costs irrespective of their acceptance as Government contract costs. For example, when a cost input base is used for the allocation of G&A costs, the contractor shall include in the base all items that would properly be part of the cost input base, whether allowable or unallowable, and these items shall bear their pro rata share of G&A costs.\
(e) The method of allocating indirect costs may require revision when there is a significant change in the nature of the business, the extent of subcontracting, fixed-asset improvement programs, inventories, the volume of sales and production, manufacturing processes, the contractor\'92s products, or other relevant circumstances.\
(f) Separate cost groupings for costs allocable to offsite locations may be necessary to permit equitable distribution of costs on the basis of the benefits accruing to the several cost objectives.\
(g) A base period for allocating indirect costs is the cost accounting period during which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period.\
(1) For contracts subject to full or modified CAS coverage, the contractor shall follow the criteria and guidance in 48 CFR9904.406 for selecting the cost accounting periods to be used in allocating indirect costs.\
(2) For contracts other than those subject to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the base period for allocating indirect costs shall be the contractor\'92s fiscal year used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\

\fs20 principles. The fiscal year will normally be 12 months, but a different period may be appropriate (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 when a change in fiscal year occurs due to a business combination or other circumstances).\
(h) Special care should be exercised in applying the principles of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section when Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) plants are involved. The distribution of corporate, division or branch office G&A expenses to such plants operating with little or no dependence on corporate administrative activities may require more precise cost groupings, detailed accounts screening, and carefully developed distribution bases.\
(i) Indirect costs that meet the definition of "excessive pass-through charge" in \cf3 52.215-23\cf4 , are unallowable.\

\f0\b 31.204 Application of principles and procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) Costs are allowable to the extent they are reasonable, allocable, and determined to be allowable under \cf3 31.201\cf4 , \cf3 31.202\cf4 , \cf3 31.203\cf4 , and \cf3 31.205\cf4 . These criteria apply to all of the selected items that follow, even if particular guidance is provided for certain items for emphasis or clarity.\
(b) (1) For the following subcontract types, costs incurred as reimbursements or payments to a subcontractor are allowable to the extent the reimbursements or payments are for costs incurred by the subcontractor that are consistent with this part:\
(i) Cost-reimbursement.\
(ii) Fixed-price incentive.\
(iii) Price redeterminable (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination and fixed-ceiling-price\
contracts with retroactive price redetermination).\
(2) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to any tier above the first firm-fixed-price subcontract or\
fixed-price subcontract with economic price adjustment provisions.\
(c) Costs incurred as payments under firm-fixed-price subcontracts or fixed-price subcontracts with economic price\
adjustment provisions or modifications thereto, for which subcontract cost analysis was performed are allowable if the price was negotiated in accordance with \cf3 31.102\cf4 .\
(d) Section \cf3 31.205 \cf4 does not cover every element of cost. Failure to include any item of cost does not imply that it is either allowable or unallowable. The determination of allowability shall be based on the principles and standards in this subpart and the treatment of similar or related selected items. When more than one subsection in \cf3 31.205 \cf4 is relevant to a contractor cost, the cost shall be apportioned among the applicable subsections, and the determination of allowability of each portion shall be based on the guidance contained in the applicable subsection. When a cost, to which more than one subsection in \cf3 31.205 \cf4 is relevant, cannot be apportioned, the determination of allowability shall be based on the guidance contained in the subsection that most specifically deals with, or best captures the essential nature of, the cost at issue.\

\f0\b 31.205 Selected costs.\

\f0\b\fs20 31.205-6 Compensation for personal services.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General. 
\f1\i0 Compensation for personal services is allowable subject to the following general criteria and additional requirements contained in other parts of this cost principle:\
(1) Compensation for personal services must be for work performed by the employee in the current year and must not represent a retroactive adjustment of prior years\'92 salaries or wages (but see paragraphs (g), (h), (j), (k), (m), and (o) of this subsection).\
(2) The total compensation for individual employees or job classes of employees must be reasonable for the work performed; however, specific restrictions on individual compensation elements apply when prescribed.\
(3) The compensation must be based upon and conform to the terms and conditions of the contractor\'92s established compensation plan or practice followed so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make the payment.\
(4) No presumption of allowability will exist where the contractor introduces major revisions of existing compensation plans or new plans and the contractor has not provided the cognizant ACO, either before implementation or within a reasonable period after it, an opportunity to review the allowability of the changes.\
(5) Costs that are unallowable under other paragraphs of this \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 are not allowable under this subsection \cf3 31.205-6 \cf4 solely on the basis that they constitute compensation for personal services.\
(6) (i) Compensation costs for certain individuals give rise to the need for special consideration. Such individuals include:\
(A) Owners of closely held corporations, members of limited liability companies, partners, sole proprietors, or members of their immediate families; and\
(B) Persons who are contractually committed to acquire a substantial financial interest in the contractor\'92s enterprise.\
(ii) For these individuals, compensation must-\
(A) Be reasonable for the personal services rendered; and\
(B) Not be a distribution of profits (which is not an allowable contract cost).\
(iii) For owners of closely held companies, compensation in excess of the costs that are deductible as compensation under the Internal Revenue Code (\cf3 26 U.S.C.\cf4 ) and regulations under it is unallowable.\
(b) Reasonableness- (1) 
\f2\i Compensation pursuant to labor-management agreements
\f1\i0 . If costs of compensation established under "arm\'92s length" labor-management agreements negotiated under the terms of the Federal Labor Relations Act\
or similar state statutes are otherwise allowable, the costs are reasonable unless, as applied to work in performing Government contracts, the costs are unwarranted by the character and circumstances of the work or discriminatory against the Government. The application of the provisions of a labor-management agreement designed to apply to a given set of circumstances and conditions of employment (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 work involving extremely hazardous activities or work not requiring recurrent use of overtime) is unwarranted when applied to a Government contract involving significantly different circumstances and conditions of employment (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 work involving less hazardous activities or work continually requiring use of overtime). It is discriminatory against the Government if it results in employee compensation (in whatever form or name) in excess of that being paid for similar non-Government work under comparable circumstances.\
(2) 
\f2\i Compensation not covered by labor-management agreements
\f1\i0 . Compensation for each employee or job class of employees must be reasonable for the work performed. Compensation is reasonable if the aggregate of each measurable and allowable element sums to a reasonable total. In determining the reasonableness of total compensation, consider only allowable individual elements of compensation. In addition to the provisions of \cf3 31.201-3\cf4 , in testing the reasonableness\
of compensation for particular employees or job classes of employees, consider factors determined to be relevant by the contracting officer. Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, conformity with compensation practices of other firms-\
(i) Of the same size;\
(ii) In the same industry;\
(iii) In the same geographic area; and\
(iv) Engaged in similar non-Government work under comparable circumstances.\
(c) [Reserved]\
(d) Form of payment. (1) Compensation for personal services includes compensation paid or to be paid in the future to employees in the form of-\
(i) Cash;\
(ii) Corporate securities, such as stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments (see paragraph (d)(2) of this subsection regarding valuation); or\

\f0\b\fs20 31.205-6\
 
\f1\b0 (iii) Other assets, products, or services.\
(2) When compensation is paid with securities of the contractor or of an affiliate, the following additional restrictions\
apply:\
(i) Valuation placed on the securities is the fair market value on the first date the number of shares awarded is\
known, determined upon the most objective basis available.\
(ii) Accruals for the cost of securities before issuing the securities to the employees are subject to adjustment\
according to the possibilities that the employees will not receive the securities and that their interest in the accruals will be forfeited.\
(e) Income tax differential pay. (1) Differential allowances for additional income taxes resulting from foreign assignments are allowable.\
(2) Differential allowances for additional income taxes resulting from domestic assignments are unallowable. (However, payments for increased employee income or Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes incident to allowable reimbursed relocation costs are allowable under \cf3 31.205-35\cf4 (a)(10).)\
(f) Bonuses and incentive compensation. (1) Bonuses and incentive compensation are allowable provided the-\
(i) Awards are paid or accrued under an agreement entered into in good faith between the contractor and the employees before the services are rendered or pursuant to an established plan or policy followed by the contractor so\
consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment; and (ii) Basis for the award is supported.\
(2) When the bonus and incentive compensation payments are deferred, the costs are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and (k) of this subsection.\
(g) 
\f2\i Severance pay
\f1\i0 . (1) Severance pay is a payment in addition to regular salaries and wages by contractors to workers whose employment is being involuntarily terminated. Payments for early retirement incentive plans are covered in paragraph (j)(6) of this subsection.\
(2) Severance pay is allowable only to the extent that, in each case, it is required by- (i) Law;\
(ii) Employer-employee agreement;\
(iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the contractor\'92s part; or (iv) Circumstances of the particular employment.\
(3) Payments made in the event of employment with a replacement contractor where continuity of employment with credit for prior length of service is preserved under substantially equal conditions of employment, or continued employment by the contractor at another facility, subsidiary, affiliate, or parent company of the contractor are not severance pay and are unallowable.\
(4) Actual normal turnover severance payments shall be allocated to all work performed in the contractor\'92s plant. However, if the contractor uses the accrual method to account for normal turnover severance payments, that method will be acceptable if the amount of the accrual is-\
(i) Reasonable in light of payments actually made for normal severances over a representative past period; and\
(ii) Allocated to all work performed in the contractor\'92s plant.\
(5) Abnormal or mass severance pay is of such a conjectural nature that accruals for this purpose are not allowable.\
However, the Government recognizes its obligation to participate, to the extent of its fair share, in any specific payment. Thus, the Government will consider allowability on a case-by-case basis.\
(6) Under \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(13) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.4304(a)(13)\cf4 , the costs of severance payments to foreign nationals employed under a service contract performed outside the United States are unallowable to the extent that such payments exceed amounts typically paid to employees providing similar services in the same industry in the United States. Further, under \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(14) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.4304(a)(14)\cf4 , all such costs of severance payments that are otherwise allowable are unallowable if the termination of employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment of activities at, a United States facility in that country at the request of the government of that country; this does not apply if the closing of a facility or curtailment of activities is made pursuant to a status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreement entered into with the government of that country before November 29, 1989. \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3744(b) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.4304(b) \cf4 permit the head of the agency to waive these cost allowability limitations under certain circumstances (see \cf3 37.113 \cf4 and the solicitation provision at \cf3 52.237-8\cf4 ).\
(h) 
\f2\i Backpay
\f1\i0 . Backpay is a retroactive adjustment of prior years\'92 salaries or wages. Backpay is unallowable except as follows:\

\fs20 (1) Payments to employees resulting from underpaid work actually performed are allowable, if required by a negotiated settlement, order, or court decree.\
(2) Payments to union employees for the difference in their past and current wage rates for working without a contract or labor agreement during labor management negotiation are allowable.\
(3) Payments to nonunion employees based upon results of union agreement negotiation are allowable only if-\
(i) A formal agreement or understanding exists between management and the employees concerning these payments;\
or\
(ii) An established policy or practice exists and is followed by the contractor so consistently as to imply, in effect, an\
agreement to make such payments.\
(i) Compensation based on changes in the prices of corporate securities or corporate security ownership, such as stock\
options, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock plans, and junior stock conversions.\
(1) Any compensation which is calculated, or valued, based on changes in the price of corporate securities is\
unallowable.\
(2) Any compensation represented by dividend payments or which is calculated based on dividend payments is\
unallowable.\
(3) If a contractor pays an employee in lieu of the employee receiving or exercising a right, option, or benefit which\
would have been unallowable under this paragraph (i), such payments are also unallowable.\
(j) Pension costs. (1) Pension plans are normally segregated into two types of plans: defined-benefit and defined-\
contribution pension plans. The contractor shall measure, assign, and allocate the costs of all defined-benefit pension plans and the costs of all defined-contribution pension plans in compliance with 48 CFR9904.412-Cost Accounting Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Cost, and 48 CFR9904.413-Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost. Pension costs are allowable subject to the referenced standards and the cost limitations and exclusions set forth in paragraph (j)(1)(i) and in paragraphs (j)(2) through (j)(6) of this subsection.\
(i) Except for nonqualified pension plans using the pay-as-you-go cost method, to be allowable in the current\
year, the contractor shall fund pension costs by the time set for filing of the Federal income tax return or any extension. Pension costs assigned to the current year, but not funded by the tax return time, are not allowable in any subsequent year. For nonqualified pension plans using the pay-as-you-go method, to be allowable in the current year, the contractor shall allocate pension costs in the cost accounting period that the pension costs are assigned.\
(ii) Pension payments must be paid pursuant to an agreement entered into in good faith between the contractor and employees before the work or services are performed and to the terms and conditions of the established plan. The cost of changes in pension plans are not allowable if the changes are discriminatory to the Government or are not intended to be applied consistently for all employees under similar circumstances in the future.\
(iii) Except as provided for early retirement benefits in paragraph (j)(6) of this subsection, one-time-only pension supplements not available to all participants of the basic plan are not allowable as pension costs, unless the supplemental benefits represent a separate pension plan and the benefits are payable for life at the option of the employee.\
(iv) Increases in payments to previously retired plan participants covering cost-of-living adjustments are allowable if paid in accordance with a policy or practice consistently followed.\
(2) 
\f2\i Defined-benefit pension plans
\f1\i0 . The cost limitations and exclusions pertaining to defined-benefit plans are as follows:\
(i) (A) Except for nonqualified pension plans, pension costs (see 48 CFR9904.412-40(a)(1)) assigned to the current accounting period, but not funded during it, are not allowable in subsequent years (except that a payment made to a fund by the time set for filing the Federal income tax return or any extension thereof is considered to have been made during such taxable year). However, any portion of pension cost computed for a cost accounting period, that exceeds the amount required to be funded pursuant to a waiver granted under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of1974 (ERISA), will be allowable in those future accounting periods in which the funding of such excess amounts occurs (see 48 CFR9904.412-50(c)(5)).\
(B) For nonqualified pension plans, except those using the pay-as-you-go cost method, allowable costs are limited to the amount allocable in accordance with 48 CFR9904.412-50(d)(2).\
(C) For nonqualified pension plans using the pay-as-you-go cost method, allowable costs are limited to the amounts allocable in accordance with 48 CFR9904.412-50(d)(3).\
(ii) Any amount funded in excess of the pension cost assigned to a cost accounting period is not allowable in that period and shall be accounted for as set forth at 48 CFR9904.412-50(a)(4). The excess amount is allowable in the future period to which it is assigned, to the extent it is not otherwise unallowable.\

\f1\b0 (iii) Increased pension costs are unallowable if the increase is caused by a delay in funding beyond 30 days after each quarter of the year to which they are assignable. If a composite rate is used for allocating pension costs between the segments of a company and if, because of differences in the timing of the funding by the segments, an inequity exists, allowable pension costs for each segment will be limited to that particular segment\'92s calculation of pension costs as provided for in 48 CFR9904.413-50(c). The contractor shall make determinations of unallowable costs in accordance with the actuarial method used in calculating pension costs.\
(iv) The contracting officer will consider the allowability of the cost of indemnifying the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) under ERISA Section 4062 or 4064 arising from terminating an employee deferred compensation plan on a case-by-case basis, provided that if insurance was required by the PBGC under ERISA Section 4023, it was so obtained and the indemnification payment is not recoverable under the insurance. Consideration under the foregoing circumstances will be primarily for the purpose of appraising the extent to which the indemnification payment is allocable to Government work. If a beneficial or other equitable relationship exists, the Government will participate, despite the requirements of \cf3 31.205-19\cf4 (c)(3) and (d)(3), in the indemnification payment to the extent of its fair share.\
(v) Increased pension costs resulting from the withdrawal of assets from a pension fund and transfer to another employee benefit plan fund, or transfer of assets to another account within the same fund, are unallowable except to the extent authorized by an advance agreement. If the withdrawal of assets from a pension fund is a plan termination under ERISA, the provisions of paragraph (j)(3) of this subsection apply. The advance agreement shall-\
(A) State the amount of the Government\'92s equitable share in the gross amount withdrawn or transferred; and\
(B) Provide that the Government receives a credit equal to the amount of the Government\'92s equitable share of the gross withdrawal or transfer.\
(3) Pension adjustments and asset reversions. (i) For segment closings, pension plan terminations, or curtailment of benefits, the amount of the adjustment shall be-\
(A) For contracts and subcontracts that are subject to full coverage under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board rules and regulations, the amount measured, assigned, and allocated in accordance with 48 CFR9904.413-50(c)(12); and\
(B) For contracts and subcontracts that are not subject to full coverage under the CAS, the amount measured, assigned, and allocated in accordance with 48 CFR9904.413-50(c)(12), except the numerator of the fraction at 48 CFR9904.413-50(c)(12)(vi) is the sum of the pension plan costs allocated to all non-CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts that are subject to \cf3 subpart 31.2 \cf4 or for which certified cost or pricing data were submitted.\
(ii) For all other situations where assets revert to the contractor, or such assets are constructively received by it for any reason, the contractor shall, at the Government\'92s option, make a refund or give a credit to the Government for its equitable share of the gross amount withdrawn. The Government\'92s equitable share shall reflect the Government\'92s participation in pension costs through those contracts for which certified cost or pricing data were submitted or that are subject to \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 . Excise taxes on pension plan asset reversions or withdrawals under this paragraph (j)(3)(ii) are unallowable in accordance with \cf3 31.205-41\cf4 (b)(6).\
(4) 
\f2\i Defined-contribution pension plans. 
\f1\i0 In addition to defined-contribution pension plans, this paragraph also covers profit sharing, savings plans, and other such plans, provided the plans fall within the definition of a pension plan at \cf3 31.001\cf4 . (i) Allowable pension cost is limited to the net contribution required to be made for a cost accounting period after\
taking into account dividends and other credits, where applicable. However, any portion of pension cost computed for a cost accounting period that exceeds the amount required to be funded pursuant to a waiver granted under the provisions of ERISA will be allowable in those future accounting periods in which the funding of such excess amounts occurs (see 48 CFR9904.412-50(c)(5)).\
(ii) The provisions of paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) and (iv) of this subsection apply to defined-contribution plans.\
(5) 
\f2\i Pension plans using the pay-as-you-go cost method
\f1\i0 . When using the pay-as-you-go cost method, the contractor shall measure, assign, and allocate the cost of pension plans in accordance with 48 CFR9904.412 and 9904.413. Pension\
costs for a pension plan using the pay-as-you-go cost method are allowable to the extent they are not otherwise unallowable. (6) 
\f2\i Early retirement incentives
\f1\i0 . An early retirement incentive is an incentive given to an employee to retire early. For contract costing purposes, costs of early retirement incentives are allowable subject to the pension cost criteria contained in\
paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iv) of this subsection provided-\
(i) The contractor measures, assigns, and allocates the costs in accordance with the contractor\'92s accounting practices\
for pension costs;\
(ii) The incentives are in accordance with the terms and conditions of an early retirement incentive plan;\

\fs20 (iii) The contractor applies the plan only to active employees. The cost of extending the plan to employees who retired or were terminated before the adoption of the plan is unallowable; and\
(iv) The present value of the total incentives given to any employee in excess of the amount of the employee\'92s annual salary for the previous fiscal year before the employee\'92s retirement is unallowable. The contractor shall compute the present value in accordance with its accounting practices for pension costs. The contractor shall account for any unallowable costs in accordance with 48 CFR9904.412-50(a)(2).\
(k) 
\f2\i Deferred compensation other than pensions. 
\f1\i0 The costs of deferred compensation awards are allowable subject to the following limitations:\
(1) The costs shall be measured, assigned, and allocated in accordance with 48 CFR 9904.415, Accounting for the Cost of Deferred Compensation.\
(2) The costs of deferred compensation awards are unallowable if the awards are made in periods subsequent to the period when the work being remunerated was performed.\
(l) Compensation incidental to business acquisitions. The following costs are unallowable: (1) Payments to employees under agreements in which they receive special compensation, in excess of the contractor\'92s normal severance pay practice, if their employment terminates following a change in the management control over, or ownership of, the contractor or a substantial portion of its assets.\
(2) Payments to employees under plans introduced in connection with a change (whether actual or prospective) in the management control over, or ownership of, the contractor or a substantial portion of its assets in which those employees receive special compensation, which is contingent upon the employee remaining with the contractor for a specified period of time.\
(m) 
\f2\i Fringe benefits
\f1\i0 . (1) Fringe benefits are allowances and services provided by the contractor to its employees as compensation in addition to regular wages and salaries. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the cost of vacations, sick leave, holidays, military leave, employee insurance, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans. Except as provided otherwise in \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 , the costs of fringe benefits are allowable to the extent that they are reasonable and are required by law, employer-employee agreement, or an established policy of the contractor.\
(2) That portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees (see \cf3 31.205-46\cf4 (d)).\
(n) 
\f2\i Employee rebate and purchase discount plans. 
\f1\i0 Rebates and purchase discounts, in whatever form, granted to employees on products or services produced by the contractor or affiliates are unallowable.\
(o) Postretirement benefits other than pensions (PRB). (1) PRB covers all benefits, other than cash benefits and life insurance benefits paid by pension plans, provided to employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents during the period following the employees\'92 retirement. Benefits encompassed include, but are not limited to, postretirement health care; life insurance provided outside a pension plan; and other welfare benefits such as tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided after retirement.\
(2) To be allowable, PRB costs shall be incurred pursuant to law, employer-employee agreement, or an established policy of the contractor, and shall comply with paragraphs (o)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection.\
(i) Pay-as-you-go. PRB costs are not accrued during the working lives of employees. Costs are assigned to the period in which-\
(A) Benefits are actually provided; or\
(B) The costs are paid to an insurer, provider, or other recipient for current year benefits or premiums. (ii) 
\f2\i Terminal funding. 
\f1\i0 PRB costs are not accrued during the working lives of the employees.\
(A) Terminal funding occurs when the entire PRB liability is paid in a lump sum upon the termination of employees (or upon conversion to such a terminal-funded plan) to an insurer or trustee to establish and maintain a fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing PRB to retirees.\
(B) Terminal funded costs shall be amortized over a period of 15 years.\
(iii) 
\f2\i Accrual basis
\f1\i0 . PRB costs are accrued during the working lives of employees. Accrued PRB costs shall comply\
with the following:\
(A) Be measured and assigned in accordance with one of the following two methods described under paragraphs\
(o)(2)(iii)(A)(1) or (o)(2)(iii)(A)(2) of this subsection:\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Generally accepted accounting principles. However, transitions from the pay-as-you-go method to the\
accrual accounting method must be handled according to paragraphs (o)(2)(iii)(A)(1)(i) through (iii) of this subsection.\

\f2\i\b0 (i) 
\f1\i0 In the year of transition from the pay-as-you-go method to accrual accounting for purposes of Government contract cost accounting, the transition obligation shall be the excess of the accumulated PRB obligation over the fair value of plan assets determined in accordance with subparagraph (E) of this section; the fair value must be reduced by the prepayment credit as determined in accordance with subparagraph (o)(2)(iii)(F) of this subsection.\

\f2\i (ii) 
\f1\i0 PRB cost attributable to the transition obligation assigned to the current year that is in excess of the amount assignable to accounting periods on the basis of a straight line amortization of the transition obligation over the average remaining working lives of active employees covered by the PRB plan or a 20-year period, whichever period is longer, is unallowable. However, if the plan is comprised of inactive participants only, the PRB cost attributable to the transition obligation assigned to the current year that is in excess of the amount assignable to accounting periods on a straight line amortization of the transition obligation over the average future life expectancy of the participants is unallowable.\

\f2\i (iii) 
\f1\i0 For a plan that transitioned from pay-as-you-go to accrual accounting for Government contract cost accounting prior to July 22, 2013, the unallowable amount of PRB cost attributable to the transition obligation amortization shall continue to be based on the cost principle in effect at the time of the transition until the original transition obligation schedule is fully amortized.\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Contributions to a welfare benefit fund determined in accordance with applicable Internal Revenue Code. Allowable PRB costs based on such contributions shall-\

\f2\i (i) 
\f1\i0 Be measured using reasonable actuarial assumptions, which shall include a health care inflation assumption unless prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code provisions governing welfare benefit funds;\

\f2\i (ii) 
\f1\i0 Be assigned to accounting periods on the basis of the average working lives of active employees covered by the PRB plan or a 15 year period, whichever period is longer. However, if the plan is comprised of inactive participants only, the cost shall be spread over the average future life expectancy of the participants; and\

\f2\i (iii) 
\f1\i0 Exclude Federal income taxes, whether incurred by the fund or the contractor (including any increase in PRB costs associated with such taxes), unless the fund holding the plan assets is tax-exempt under the provisions of \cf3 26 USC 501(c)\cf4 .\
(B) Be paid to an insurer or trustee to establish and maintain a fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing PRB to retirees. The assets shall be segregated in the trust, or otherwise effectively restricted, so that they cannot be used by the employer for other purposes.\
(C) Be calculated in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices as promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board.\
(D) Eliminate from costs of current and future periods the accumulated value of any prior period costs that were unallowable in accordance with paragraph (o)(3) of this section, adjusted for interest under paragraph (o)(4) of this section.\
(E) Calculate the unfunded actuarial liability (unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation) using the market (fair) value of assets that have been accumulated by funding costs assigned to prior periods for contract accounting purposes.\
(F) Recognize as a prepayment credit the market (fair) value of assets that were accumulated by deposits or contributions that were not used to fund costs assigned to previous periods for contract accounting purposes.\
(G) Comply with the following when changing from one accrual accounting method to another: the contractor\
shall-\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 Treat the change in the unfunded actuarial liability (unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation) as a gain or loss; and\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 Present an analysis demonstrating that all costs assigned to prior periods have been accounted for in accordance with paragraphs (o)(2)(iii)(D), (E), and (F) of this section to ensure that no duplicate recovery of costs exists. Any duplicate recovery of costs due to the change from one method to another is unallowable. The analysis and new accrual accounting method may be a subject appropriate for an advance agreement in accordance with \cf3 31.109\cf4 .\
(3) To be allowable, PRB costs must be funded by the time set for filing the Federal income tax return or any extension thereof, or paid to an insurer, provider, or other recipient by the time set for filing the Federal income tax return or extension thereof. PRB costs assigned to the current year, but not funded, paid or otherwise liquidated by the tax return due date as extended are not allowable in any subsequent year.\
(4) Increased PRB costs caused by delay in funding beyond 30 days after each quarter of the year to which they are assignable are unallowable.\
(5) The Government shall receive an equitable share of any amount of previously funded PRB costs which revert or inure to the contractor. Such equitable share shall reflect the Government\'92s previous participation in PRB costs through those contracts for which certified cost or pricing data were required or which were subject to \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 .\

\f2\i (1) 
\f1\i0 The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or any individual acting in a similar capacity at the contractor's headquarters;\

\f2\i (2) 
\f1\i0 The four most highly compensated employees in management positions at the contractor's headquarters, other than the CEO; and\

\f2\i (3) 
\f1\i0 If the contractor has intermediate home offices or segments that report directly to the contractor's headquarters, the five most highly compensated employees in management positions at each such intermediate home office or segment.\
(B) Effective January 2, 1999, the five most highly compensated employees in management positions at each home office and each segment of the contractor, whether or not the home office or segment reports directly to the contractor's headquarters.\
(iii) Fiscal year means the fiscal year established by the contractor for accounting purposes.\
(iv) Contractor's headquarters means the highest organizational level from which executive compensation costs are allocated to Government contracts.\
(2) 
\f2\i Senior executive compensation limit for contracts awarded before June 24, 2014

See \cf3 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ ContractorCompensationCapContractsAwardedBeforeJune24.pdf\cf4 .\
(4) All employee compensation limit for contracts awarded on or after June 24, 2014.\
(i) 
\f2\i Applicability
\f1\i0 . This paragraph (p)(4) applies to all executive agency contracts awarded on or after June 24, 2014,\
and any subcontracts thereunder.\
(ii) Costs incurred on or after June 24, 2014, for the compensation of all employees in excess of the benchmark\
compensation amount determined applicable for the contractor fiscal year by the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) are unallowable under \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(16) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C 4304\cf4 (a)(16), as in effect on or after June 24, 2014, pursuant to section 702 of Pub.

See \cf3 http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/cecp\cf4 .\
(iii) Exceptions. An agency head may establish one or more narrowly targeted exceptions for scientists, engineers, or other specialists upon a determination that such exceptions are needed to ensure that the executive agency has continued access to needed skills and capabilities. In making such a determination, the agency shall consider, at a minimum, for each contractor employee in a narrowly targeted excepted position-\
(A) The amount of taxpayer funded compensation to be received by each employee; and\
(B) The duties and services performed by each employee.\
(q) Employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). (1) An ESOP is a stock bonus plan designed to invest primarily in the stock\
of the employer corporation. The contractor\'92s contributions to an Employee Stock Ownership Trust (ESOT) may be in the form of cash, stock, or property.\
(2) Costs of ESOPs are allowable subject to the following conditions:\
(i) The contractor measures, assigns, and allocates costs in accordance with 48 CFR 9904.415.\
(ii) Contributions by the contractor in any oneyear that exceed the deductibility limits of the Internal Revenue Code\
for that year are unallowable.\
(iii) When the contribution is in the form of stock, the value of the stock contribution is limited to the fair market\
value of the stock on the date that title is effectively transferred to the trust. (iv) When the contribution is in the form of cash-\
(A) Stock purchases by the ESOT in excess of fair market value are unallowable; and\
(B) When stock purchases are in excess of fair market value, the contractor shall credit the amount of the excess to the same indirect cost pools that were charged for the ESOP contributions in the year in which the stock purchase occurs. However, when the trust purchases the stock with borrowed funds which will be repaid over a period of years by cash contributions from the contractor to the trust, the contractor shall credit the excess price over fair market value to the indirect cost pools pro rata over the period of years during which the contractor contributes the cash used by the trust to repay the loan.\
(v) When the fair market value of unissued stock or stock of a closely held corporation is not readily determinable, the valuation will be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the guidelines for valuation used by the IRS.\

\f0\b 31.205-7 Contingencies.\

\f1\b0 (a) "Contingency," as used in this subpart, means a possible future event or condition arising from presently known or unknown causes, the outcome of which is indeterminable at the present time.\
(b) Costs for contingencies are generally unallowable for historical costing purposes because such costing deals with costs incurred and recorded on the contractor\'92s books. However, in some cases, as for example, terminations, a contingency factor may be recognized when it is applicable to a past period to give recognition to minor unsettled factors in the interest of expediting settlement.\
(c) In connection with estimates of future costs, contingencies fall into two categories:\
(1) Those that may arise from presently known and existing conditions, the effects of which are foreseeable within\
reasonable limits of accuracy; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 anticipated costs of rejects and defective work. Contingencies of this category are to be included in the estimates of future costs so as to provide the best estimate of performance cost.\

\fs20 (2) Those that may arise from presently known or unknown conditions, the effect of which cannot be measured\
so precisely as to provide equitable results to the contractor and to the Government; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 results of pending litigation. Contingencies of this category are to be excluded from cost estimates under the several items of cost, but should be disclosed separately (including the basis upon which the contingency is computed) to facilitate the negotiation of appropriate contractual coverage. (See, for example, \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 (g) and \cf3 31.205-19\cf4 .)\

\f0\b 31.205-8 Contributions or donations.\

\f1\b0 Contributions or donations, including cash, property and services, regardless of recipient, are unallowable, except as provided in \cf3 31.205-1\cf4 (e)(3).\

\f0\b 31.205-9 [Reserved]\
31.205-10 Cost of money.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i General
\f1\i0 . Cost of money-\
(1) Is an imputed cost that is not a form of interest on borrowings (see \cf3 31.205-20\cf4 );\
(2) Is an "incurred cost" for cost-reimbursement purposes under applicable cost-reimbursement contracts and for\
progress payment purposes under fixed-price contracts; and (3) Refers to-\
(i) Facilities capital cost of money (48 CFR9904.414); and\
(ii) Cost of money as an element of the cost of capital assets under construction (48 CFR9904.417). (b) Cost of money is allowable, provided-\
(1) It is measured, assigned, and allocated to contracts in accordance with 48 CFR9904.414 or measured and added to the cost of capital assets under construction in accordance with 48 CFR9904.417, as applicable;\
(2) The requirements of \cf3 31.205-52\cf4 , which limit the allowability of cost of money, are followed; and\
(3) The estimated facilities capital cost of money is specifically identified and proposed in cost proposals relating to the contract under which the cost is to be claimed.\
(c) Actual interest cost in lieu of the calculated imputed cost of money is unallowable.\

\f0\b 31.205-11 Depreciation.\

\f1\b0 (a) Depreciation on a contractor\'92s plant, equipment, and other capital facilities is an allowable contract cost, subject to\
the limitations contained in this cost principle. For tangible personal property, only estimated residual values that exceed 10 percent of the capitalized cost of the asset need be used in establishing depreciable costs. Where either the declining balance method of depreciation or the class life asset depreciation range system is used, the residual value need not be deducted from capitalized cost to determine depreciable costs. Depreciation cost that would significantly reduce the book value of a tangible capital asset below its residual value is unallowable.\
(b) Contractors having contracts subject to 48 CFR9904.409, Depreciation of Tangible Capital Assets, shall adhere to the requirement of that standard for all fully CAS-covered contracts and may elect to adopt the standard for all other contracts. All requirements of 48 CFR9904.409 are applicable if the election is made, and contractors must continue to follow it until notification of final acceptance of all deliverable items on all open negotiated Government contracts.\
(c) For contracts to which 48 CFR9904.409 is not applied, except as indicated in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this subsection, allowable depreciation shall not exceed the amount used for financial accounting purposes, and shall be determined in a manner consistent with the depreciation policies and procedures followed in the same segment on non-Government business.\
(d) Depreciation, rental, or use charges are unallowable on property acquired from the Government at no cost by the contractor or by any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor under common control.\
(e) The depreciation on any item which meets the criteria for allowance at price under \cf3 31.205-26\cf4 (e) may be based on that price, provided the same policies and procedures are used for costing all business of the using division, subsidiary, or organization under common control.\
(f) No depreciation or rental is allowed on property fully depreciated by the contractor or by any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor under common control. However, a reasonable charge for using fully depreciated property may be agreed upon and allowed (but, see \cf3 31.109\cf4 (h)(2)). In determining the charge, consideration shall be given to cost, total estimated useful life at the time of negotiations, effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased efficiency due to age, and the amount of depreciation previously charged to Government contracts or subcontracts.\
(g) Whether or not the contract is otherwise subject to CAS the following apply: 31.2-14\

\f1\b0 (1) The requirements of \cf3 31.205-52 \cf4 shall be observed.\
(2) In the event of a write-down from carrying value to fair value as a result of impairments caused by events or changes in circumstances, allowable depreciation of the impaired assets is limited to the amounts that would have been allowed had the assets not been written down (see \cf3 31.205-16\cf4 (g)). However, this does not preclude a change in depreciation resulting from other causes such as permissible changes in estimates of service life, consumption of services, or residual value.\
(3) (i) In the event the contractor reacquires property involved in a sale and leaseback arrangement, allowable depreciation of reacquired property shall be based on the net book value of the asset as of the date the contractor originally became a lessee of the property in the sale and leaseback arrangement-\
(A) Adjusted for any allowable gain or loss determined in accordance with \cf3 31.205-16\cf4 (b); and\
(B) Less any amount of depreciation expense included in the calculation of the amount that would have been allowed had the contractor retained title under \cf3 31.205-11\cf4 (h)(1) and \cf3 31.205-36\cf4 (b)(2).\
(ii) As used in this paragraph (g)(3), "reacquired property" is property that generated either any depreciation expense or any cost of money considered in the calculation of the limitations under \cf3 31.205-11\cf4 (h)(1) and \cf3 31.205-36\cf4 (b)(2) during the most recent accounting period prior to the date of reacquisition.\
(h) A "capital lease," as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board\'92s Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 840, Leases, is subject to the requirements of this cost principle. (See \cf3 31.205-36 \cf4 for Operating Leases.) FASB ASC 840 requires that capital leases be treated as purchased assets, 
\f2\i i.e.
\f1\i0 , be capitalized, and the capitalized value of such assets be distributed over their useful lives as depreciation charges or over the leased life as amortization charges, as appropriate, except that-\
(1) Lease costs under a sale and leaseback arrangement are allowable only up to the amount that would be allowed if the contractor retained title, computed based on the net book value of the asset on the date the contractor becomes a lessee of the property adjusted for any gain or loss recognized in accordance with \cf3 31.205-16\cf4 (b); and\
(2) If it is determined that the terms of the capital lease have been significantly affected by the fact that the lessee and lessor are related, depreciation charges are not allowable in excess of those that would have occurred if the lease contained terms consistent with those found in a lease between unrelated parties.\

\f0\b 31.205-12 Economic planning costs.\

\f1\b0 Economic planning costs are the costs of general long-range management planning that is concerned with the future overall development of the contractor\'92s business and that may take into account the eventual possibility of economic dislocations or fundamental alterations in those markets in which the contractor currently does business. Economic planning costs are allowable. Economic planning costs do not include organization or reorganization costs covered by \cf3 31.205-27\cf4 . See \cf3 31.205-38 \cf4 for market planning costs other than economic planning costs.\

\f0\b 31.205-13 Employee morale, health, welfare, food service, and dormitory costs and credits.\

\f1\b0 (a) Aggregate costs incurred on activities designed to improve working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee morale, and employee performance (less income generated by these activities) are allowable, subject to the limitations contained in this subsection. Some examples of allowable activities are-\
(1) House publications;\
(2) Health clinics;\
(3) Wellness/fitness centers;\
(4) Employee counseling services; and\
(5) Food and dormitory services for the contractor\'92s employees at or near the contractor\'92s facilities. These services\
include-\
(i) Operating or furnishing facilities for cafeterias, dining rooms, canteens, lunch wagons, vending machines, living\
accommodations; and\
(ii) Similar types of services.\
(b) Costs of gifts are unallowable. (Gifts do not include awards for performance made pursuant to \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 (f) or awards made in recognition of employee achievements pursuant to an established contractor plan or policy.)\
(c) Costs of recreation are unallowable, except for the costs of employees\'92 participation in company sponsored sports teams or employee organizations designed to improve company loyalty, team work, or physical fitness.\
(d) (1) The allowability of food and dormitory losses are determined by the following factors:\

\fs20 (i) Losses from operating food and dormitory services are allowable only if the contractor\'92s objective is to operate such services on a break-even basis.\
(ii) Losses sustained because food services or lodging accommodations are furnished without charge or at prices or rates which obviously would not be conducive to the accomplishment of the objective in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this subsection are not allowable, except as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this subsection.\
(iii) A loss may be allowed to the extent that the contractor can demonstrate that unusual circumstances exist such that even with efficient management, operating the services on a break-even basis would require charging inordinately high prices, or prices or rates higher than those charged by commercial establishments offering the same services in the same geographical areas. The following are examples of unusual circumstances:\
(A) The contractor must provide food or dormitory services at remote locations where adequate commercial facilities are not reasonably available.\
(B) The contractor\'92s charged (but unproductive) labor costs would be excessive if the services were not available.\
(C) If cessation or reduction of food or dormitory operations will not otherwise yield net cost savings.\
(2) Costs of food and dormitory services shall include an allocable share of indirect expenses pertaining to these\
activities.\
(e) When the contractor has an arrangement authorizing an employee association to provide or operate a service, such as\
vending machines in the contractor\'92s plant, and retain the profits, such profits shall be treated in the same manner as if the contractor were providing the service (but see paragraph (f) of this subsection).\
(f) Contributions by the contractor to an employee organization, including funds from vending machine receipts or similar sources, are allowable only to the extent that the contractor demonstrates that an equivalent amount of the costs incurred by the employee organization would be allowable if directly incurred by the contractor..\

\f0\b 31.205-14 Entertainment costs.\

\f1\b0 Costs of amusement, diversions, social activities, and any directly associated costs such as tickets to shows or sports events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities are unallowable. Costs made specifically unallowable under this cost principle are not allowable under any other cost principle. Costs of membership in social, dining, or country clubs or other organizations having the same purposes are also unallowable, regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.\

\f0\b 31.205-15 Fines, penalties, and mischarging costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) Costs of fines and penalties resulting from violations of, or failure of the contractor to comply with, Federal, State, local, or foreign laws and regulations, are unallowable except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or written instructions from the contracting officer.\
(b) Costs incurred in connection with, or related to, the mischarging of costs on Government contracts are unallowable when the costs are caused by, or result from, alteration or destruction of records, or other false or improper charging or recording of costs. Such costs include those incurred to measure or otherwise determine the magnitude of the improper charging, and costs incurred to remedy or correct the mischarging, such as costs to rescreen and reconstruct records.\

\f0\b 31.205-16 Gains and losses on disposition or impairment of depreciable property or other capital assets.\

\f1\b0 (a) Gains and losses from the sale, retirement, or other disposition (but see \cf3 31.205-19\cf4 ) of depreciable property shall\
be included in the year in which they occur as credits or charges to the cost grouping(s) in which the depreciation or amortization applicable to those assets was included (but see paragraph (f) of this subsection). However, no gain or loss shall be recognized as a result of the transfer of assets in a business combination (see \cf3 31.205-52\cf4 ).\
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (c) of this subsection, when costs of depreciable property are subject to the sale and leaseback limitations in \cf3 31.205-11\cf4 (h)(1) or \cf3 31.205-36\cf4 (b)(2)-\
(1) The gain or loss is the difference between the net amount realized and the undepreciated balance of the asset on the date the contractor becomes a lessee; and\
(2) When the application of (b)(1) of this subsection results in a loss-\
(i) The allowable portion of the loss is zero if the fair market value exceeds the undepreciated balance of the asset on\
the date the contractor becomes a lessee; and\
(ii) The allowable portion of the loss is limited to the difference between the fair market value and the undepreciated\
balance of the asset on the date the contractor becomes a lessee if the fair market value is less than the undepreciated balance of the asset on the date the contractor becomes a lessee.\

\f1\b0 (c) Gains and losses on disposition of tangible capital assets, including those acquired under capital leases (see\
\cf3 31.205-11\cf4 (h)), shall be considered as adjustments of depreciation costs previously recognized. The gain or loss for each asset disposed of is the difference between the net amount realized, including insurance proceeds from involuntary conversions, and its undepreciated balance.\
(d) The gain recognized for contract costing purposes shall be limited to the difference between the acquisition cost (or for assets acquired under a capital lease, the value at which the leased asset is capitalized) of the asset and its undepreciated balance (except see paragraphs (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection).\
(e) Special considerations apply to an involuntary con-version which occurs when a contractor\'92s property is destroyed by events over which the owner has no control, such as fire, windstorm, flood, accident, theft, etc., and an insurance award is recovered. The following govern involuntary conversions:\
(1) When there is a cash award and the converted asset is not replaced, gain or loss shall be recognized in the period of disposition. The gain recognized for contract costing purposes shall be limited to the difference between the acquisition cost of the asset and its undepreciated balance.\
(2) When the converted asset is replaced, the contractor shall either-\
(i) Adjust the depreciable basis of the new asset by the amount of the total realized gain or loss; or\
(ii) Recognize the gain or loss in the period of disposition, in which case the Government shall participate to the\
same extent as outlined in paragraph (e)(1) of this subsection.\
(f) Gains and losses on the disposition of depreciable property shall not be recognized as a separate charge or credit when-\
(1) Gains and losses are processed through the depreciation reserve account and reflected in the depreciation allowable under \cf3 31.205-11\cf4 ; or\
(2) The property is exchanged as part of the purchase price of a similar item, and the gain or loss is taken into consideration in the depreciation cost basis of the new item.\
(g) Gains and losses arising from mass or extraordinary sales, retirements, or other disposition other than through business combinations shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.\
(h) Gains and losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange of capital assets other than depreciable property shall be excluded in computing contract costs.\
(i) With respect to long-lived tangible and identifiable intangible assets held for use, no loss shall be allowed for a write- down from carrying value to fair value as a result of impairments caused by events or changes in circumstances (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 environmental damage, idle facilities arising from a declining business base, etc.). If depreciable property or other capital assets have been written down from carrying value to fair value due to impairments, gains or losses upon disposition shall be the amounts that would have been allowed had the assets not been written down.\

\f0\b 31.205-17 Idle facilities and idle capacity costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Definitions
\f1\i0 . As used in this subsection-\

\f2\i Costs of idle facilities or idle capacity 
\f1\i0 means costs such as maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 property taxes, insurance, and depreciation.\

\f2\i Facilities 
\f1\i0 means plant or any portion thereof (including land integral to the operation), equipment, individually or collectively, or any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the contractor.\

\f2\i Idle capacity 
\f1\i0 means the unused capacity of partially used facilities. It is the difference between that which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis, less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays, and the extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period. A multiple-shift basis may be used in the calculation instead of a one-shift basis if it can be shown that this amount of usage could normally be expected for the type of facility involved.\

\f2\i Idle facilities 
\f1\i0 means completely unused facilities that are excess to the contractor\'92s current needs. (b) The costs of idle facilities are unallowable unless the facilities-\
(1) Are necessary to meet fluctuations in workload; or\
(2) Were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in requirements, production economies, reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen. (Costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period, ordinarily not to exceed 1 year, depending upon the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of the idle facilities (but see \cf3 31.205-42\cf4 )).\
(c) Costs of idle capacity are costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or overhead rates from period to period. Such costs are allowable provided the capacity is necessary or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economics, or security\

\fs20 practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire plant or among a group of assets having substantially the same function may be idle facilities.\
(d) Any costs to be paid directly by the Government for idle facilities or idle capacity reserved for defense mobilization production shall be the subject of a separate agreement.\

\f0\b 31.205-18 Independent research and development and bid and proposal costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Definitions. 
\f1\i0 As used in this subsection-\

\f2\i Applied research 
\f1\i0 means that effort which (1) normally follows basic research, but may not be severable from the related basic research, (2) attempts to determine and exploit the potential of scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, materials, processes, methods, devices, or techniques, and (3) attempts to advance the state of the art. Applied research does not include efforts whose principal aim is design, development, or test of specific items or services to be considered for sale; these efforts are within the definition of the term "development," defined in this subsection.\

\f2\i Basic research 
\f1\i0 (see \cf3 2.101\cf4 ).\

\f2\i Bid and proposal (B&P) costs 
\f1\i0 means the costs incurred in preparing, submitting, and supporting bids and proposals (whether or not solicited) on potential Government or non-Government contracts. The term does not include the costs of effort sponsored by a grant or cooperative agreement, or required in the performance of a contract.\

\f2\i Company 
\f1\i0 means all divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates of the contractor under common control.\

\f2\i Development 
\f1\i0 means the systematic use, under whatever name, of scientific and technical knowledge in the design, development, test, or evaluation of a potential new product or service (or of an improvement in an existing product or service) for the purpose of meeting specific performance requirements or objectives. Development includes the functions of design engineering, prototyping, and engineering testing. Development excludes-\
(1) Subcontracted technical effort which is for the sole purpose of developing an additional source for an existing product, or\
(2) Development effort for manufacturing or production materials, systems, processes, methods, equipment, tools, and techniques not intended for sale.\

\f2\i Independent research and development (IR&D) 
\f1\i0 means a contractor\'92s IR&D cost that consists of projects falling within the four following areas: (1) basic research, (2) applied research, (3) development, and (4) systems and other concept formulation studies. The term does not include the costs of effort sponsored by a grant or required in the performance of a contract. IR&D effort shall not include technical effort expended in developing and preparing technical data specifically to support submitting a bid or proposal.\

\f2\i Systems and other concept formulation studies 
\f1\i0 means analyses and study efforts either related to specific IR&D efforts or directed toward identifying desirable new systems, equipment or components, or modifications and improvements to existing systems, equipment, or components.\
(b) 
\f2\i Composition and allocation of costs. 
\f1\i0 The requirements of 48 CFR 9904.420, Accounting for independent research and development costs and bid and proposal costs, are incorporated in their entirety and shall apply as follows-\
(1) 
\f2\i Fully-CAS-covered contracts. 
\f1\i0 Contracts that are fully-CAS-covered shall be subject to all requirements of 48 CFR 9904.420.\
(2) 
\f2\i Modified CAS-covered and non-CAS-covered contracts. 
\f1\i0 Contracts that are not CAS-covered or that contain terms or conditions requiring modified CAS coverage shall be subject to all requirements of 48 CFR9904.420 except 48 CFR 9904.420-50(e)(2) and 48 CFR 9904.420-50(f)(2) , which are not then applicable. However, non-CAS-covered or modified CAS-covered contracts awarded at a time the contractor has CAS-covered contracts requiring compliance with 48 CFR 9904.420, shall be subject to all the requirements of 48 CFR 9904.420. When the requirements of 48 CFR 9904.420-50(e)(2) and 48 CFR 9904.420-50(f)(2) are not applicable, the following apply:\
(i) IR&D and B&P costs shall be allocated to final cost objectives on the same basis of allocation used for the G&A expense grouping of the profit center (see \cf3 31.001\cf4 ) in which the costs are incurred. However, when IR&D and B&P costs clearly benefit other profit centers or benefit the entire company, those costs shall be allocated through the G&A of the other profit centers or through the corporate G&A, as appropriate.\
(ii) If allocations of IR&D or B&P through the G&A base do not provide equitable cost allocation, the contracting officer may approve use of a different base.\
(c) 
\f2\i Allowability. 
\f1\i0 Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this subsection, or as provided in agency regulations, costs for IR&D and B&P are allowable as indirect expenses on contracts to the extent that those costs are allocable and reasonable.\

\f1\b0 (d) Deferred IR&D costs. (1) IR&D costs that were incurred in previous accounting periods are unallowable, except when a contractor has developed a specific product at its own risk in anticipation of recovering the development costs in the sale price of the product provided that-\
(i) The total amount of IR&D costs applicable to the product can be identified;\
(ii) The proration of such costs to sales of the product is reasonable;\
(iii) The contractor had no Government business during the time that the costs were incurred or did not allocate\
IR&D costs to Government contracts except to prorate the cost of developing a specific product to the sales of that product; and\
(iv) No costs of current IR&D programs are allocated to Government work except to prorate the costs of developing a specific product to the sales of that product.\
(2) When deferred costs are recognized, the contract (except firm-fixed-price and fixed-price with economic price adjustment) will include a specific provision setting forth the amount of deferred IR&D costs that are allocable to the contract. The negotiation memorandum will state the circumstances pertaining to the case and the reason for accepting the deferred costs.\
(e) Cooperative arrangements. (1) IR&D costs may be incurred by contractors working jointly with one or more non-Federal entities pursuant to a cooperative arrangement (for example, joint ventures, limited partnerships, teaming arrangements, and collaboration and consortium arrangements). IR&D costs also may include costs contributed by contractors in performing cooperative research and development agreements, or similar arrangements, entered into under-\
(i) Section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Transfer Act of1980 (\cf3 15 U.S.C.3710(a)\cf4 );\

allowable IR&D costs if the work performed would have been allowed as contractor IR&D had there been no cooperative arrangement.\
(3) Costs incurred in preparing, submitting, and supporting offers on potential cooperative arrangements are allowable to the extent they are allocable, reasonable, and not otherwise unallowable.\

\f0\b 31.205-19 Insurance and indemnification.\

\f1\b0 (a) Insurance by purchase or by self-insuring includes-\
(1) Coverage the contractor is required to carry or to have approved, under the terms of the contract; and (2) Any other coverage the contractor maintains in connection with the general conduct of its business.\
(b) For purposes of applying the provisions of this subsection, the Government considers insurance provided by captive insurers (insurers owned by or under control of the contractor) as self-insurance, and charges for it shall comply with the provisions applicable to self-insurance costs in this subsection. However, if the captive insurer also sells insurance to the general public in substantial quantities and it can be demonstrated that the charge to the contractor is based on competitive market forces, the Government will consider the insurance as purchased insurance.\
(c) Whether or not the contract is subject to CAS, self-insurance charges are allowable subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection and the following limitations:\
(1) The contractor shall measure, assign, and allocate costs in accordance with 48 CFR9904.416, Accounting for Insurance Costs.\
(2) The contractor shall comply with (48 CFR) \cf3 part 28\cf4 . However, approval of a contractor\'92s insurance program in accordance with \cf3 part 28 \cf4 does not constitute a determination as to the allowability of the program\'92s cost.\
(3) If purchased insurance is available, any self-insurance charge plus insurance administration expenses in excess of the cost of comparable purchased insurance plus associated insurance administration expenses is unallowable.\
(4) Self-insurance charges for risks of catastrophic losses are unallowable (see \cf3 28.308\cf4 (e)).\
(d) Purchased insurance costs are allowable, subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection and the following limitations:\

(iv) Costs of insurance for the risk of loss of Government property are allowable to the extent that-\
(A) The contractor is liable for such loss;\
(B) The contracting officer has not revoked the Government\'92s assumption of risk (see \cf3 45.104\cf4 (b)); and\
(C) Such insurance does not cover loss of Government property that results from willful misconduct or lack of\
good faith on the part of any of the contractor\'92s managerial personnel (as described in FAR \cf3 52.245-1\cf4 (h)(1)(ii)).\
(v) Costs of insurance on the lives of officers, partners, proprietors, or employees are allowable only to the extent\
that the insurance represents additional compensation (see \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 31.205-33 Professional and consultant service costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Definition. "
\f1\i0 Professional and consultant services," as used in this subsection, means those services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill and who are not officers or employees of the contractor. Examples include those services acquired by contractors or subcontractors in order to enhance their legal, economic, financial, or technical positions. Professional and consultant services are generally acquired to obtain information, advice, opinions, alternatives, conclusions, recommendations, training, or direct assistance, such as studies, analyses, evaluations, liaison with Government officials, or other forms of representation.\
(b) Costs of professional and consultant services are allowable subject to this paragraph and paragraphs (c) through (f) of this subsection when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Government (but see \cf3 31.205-30 \cf4 and \cf3 31.205-47\cf4 ).\
(c) Costs of professional and consultant services performed under any of the following circumstances are unallowable: (1) Services to improperly obtain, distribute, or use information or data protected by law or regulation (
\f2\i e.g.,\

\f1\i0 \cf3 52.215-1\cf4 (e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data).\
(2) Services that are intended to improperly influence the contents of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or\
quotations, or the selection of sources for contract award, whether award is by the Government, or by a prime contractor or subcontractor.\
(3) Any other services obtained, performed, or otherwise resulting in violation of any statute or regulation prohibiting improper business practices or conflicts of interest.\
(4) Services performed which are not consistent with the purpose and scope of the services contracted for or otherwise agreed to.\
(d) In determining the allowability of costs (including retainer fees) in a particular case, no single factor or any special combination of factors is necessarily determinative. However, the contracting officer shall consider the following factors, among others:\
(1) The nature and scope of the service rendered in relation to the service required.\
(2) The necessity of contracting for the service, considering the contractor\'92s capability in the particular area. (3) The past pattern of acquiring such services and their costs, particularly in the years prior to the award of\
Government contracts.\
(4) The impact of Government contracts on the contractor\'92s business.\
(5) Whether the proportion of Government work to the contractor\'92s total business is such as to influence the contractor\
in favor of incurring the cost, particularly when the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under Government contracts.\
(6) Whether the service can be performed more economically by employment rather than by contracting.\
(7) The qualifications of the individual or concern rendering the service and the customary fee charged, especially on non-Government contracts.\
(8) Adequacy of the contractual agreement for the service (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 description of the service, estimate of time required, rate of compensation, termination provisions).\
(e) Retainer fees, to be allowable, must be supported by evidence that-\
(1) The services covered by the retainer agreement are necessary and customary;\
(2) The level of past services justifies the amount of the retainer fees (if no services were rendered, fees are not\
automatically unallowable);\
(3) The retainer fee is reasonable in comparison with maintaining an in-house capability to perform the covered\
services, when factors such as cost and level of expertise are considered; and\
(4) The actual services performed are documented in accordance with paragraph (f) of this subsection.\
(f) Fees for services rendered are allowable only when supported by evidence of the nature and scope of the service furnished (see also \cf3 31.205-38\cf4 (c)). However, retainer agreements generally are not based on specific statements of work. Evidence necessary to determine that work performed is proper and does not violate law or regulation shall include-\

\f1\b0 Service and warranty costs include those arising from fulfillment of any contractual obligation of a contractor to provide services such as installation, training, correcting defects in the products, replacing defective parts, and making refunds in the case of inadequate performance. When not inconsistent with the terms of the contract, service and warranty costs are allowable. However, care should be exercised to avoid duplication of the allowance as an element of both estimated product cost and risk.\

\f0\b 31.205-40 Special tooling and special test equipment costs.\

\f1\b0 (a) \cf2 The terms \'93 
\f2\i special tooling\'94 
\f1\i0 and \'93 
\f2\i special test equipment\'94 
\f1\i0 are defined in \cf3 2.101\cf2 .\
(b) The cost of special tooling and special test equipment used in performing one or more Government contracts is allowable and shall be allocated to the specific Government contract or contracts for which acquired, except that the cost of-\
(1) Items acquired by the contractor before the effective date of the contract (or replacement of such items), whether or not altered or adapted for use in performing the contract, and\
(2) Items which the contract schedule specifically excludes, shall be allowable only as depreciation or amortization. (c) When items are disqualified as special tooling or special test equipment because with relatively minor expense they can be made suitable for general purpose use and have a value as such commensurate with their value as special tooling or\
special test equipment, the cost of adapting the items for use under the contract and the cost of returning them to their prior configuration are allowable.\

\f0\b 31.205-41 Taxes.\

\f1\b0 (a) The following types of costs are allowable:\

\f1\b0 (2) Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, refunding operations, or reorganizations (see \cf3 31.205-20 \cf4 and \cf3 31.205-27\cf4 ).\
(3) Taxes from which exemptions are available to the contractor directly, or available to the contractor based on an exemption afforded the Government, except when the contracting officer determines that the administrative burden incident to obtaining the exemption outweighs the corresponding benefits accruing to the Government. When partial exemption from a tax is attributable to Government contract activity, taxes charged to such work in excess of that amount resulting from application of the preferential treatment are unallowable. These provisions intend that tax preference attributable to Government contract activity be realized by the Government. The term "exemption" means freedom from taxation in whole or in part and includes a tax abatement or reduction resulting from mode of assessment, method of calculation, or otherwise.\
(4) Special assessments on land that represent capital improvements.\
(5) Taxes (including excises) on real or personal property, or on the value, use, possession or sale thereof, which is used solely in connection with work other than on Government contracts (see paragraph (c) of this section).\
(6) Any excise tax in subtitleD, Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code of1986, as amended. That chapter includes excise taxes imposed in connection with qualified pension plans, welfare plans, deferred compensation plans, or other similar types of plans.\
(7) Income tax accruals designed to account for the tax effects of differences between taxable income and pretax income as reflected by the books of account and financial statements.\
(8) Any tax imposed under 26 U.S.C. 5000 C.\
(c) Taxes on property (see paragraph (b)(5) of this section) used solely in connection with either non-Government or\
Government work should be considered directly applicable to the respective category of work unless the amounts involved are insignificant or comparable results would otherwise be obtained; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 taxes on contractor-owned work-in-process which is used solely in connection with non-Government work should be allocated to such work; taxes on contractor-owned work-in-process inventory (and Government-owned work-in-process inventory when taxed) used solely in connection with Government work should be charged to such work. The cost of taxes incurred on property used in both Government and non-Government work shall be apportioned to all such work based upon the use of such property on the respective final cost objectives.\
(d) Any taxes, interest, or penalties that were allowed as contract costs and are refunded to the contractor shall be credited or paid to the Government in the manner it directs. If a contractor or subcontractor obtains a foreign tax credit that reduces its U.S. Federal income tax because of the payment of any tax or duty allowed as contract costs, and if those costs were reimbursed by a foreign government, the amount of the reduction shall be paid to the Treasurer of the United States at the time the Federal income tax return is filed. However, any interest actually paid or credited to a contractor incident to a refund of tax, interest, or penalty shall be paid or credited to the Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the contractor had been reimbursed by the Government for the taxes, interest, or penalties.\

\f0\b 31.205-42 Termination costs.\

\f1\b0 Contract terminations generally give rise to the incurrence of costs or the need for special treatment of costs that would not have arisen had the contract not been terminated. The following cost principles peculiar to termination situations are to be used in conjunction with the other cost principles in \cf3 subpart 31.2\cf4 :\
(a) 
\f2\i Common items. 
\f1\i0 The costs of items reasonably usable on the contractor\'92s other work shall not be allowable unless\
the contractor submits evidence that the items could not be retained at cost without sustaining a loss. The contracting\
officer should consider the contractor\'92s plans and orders for current and planned production when determining if items can reasonably be used on other work of the contractor. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the contractor shall be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably usable on the contractor\'92s other work. Any acceptance of common items as allocable to the terminated portion of the contract should be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirements of other work.\
(b) 
\f2\i Costs continuing after termination. 
\f1\i0 Despite all reasonable efforts by the contractor, costs which cannot be discontinued immediately after the effective date of termination are generally allowable. However, any costs continuing after the effective date of the termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the contractor to discontinue the costs shall be unallowable.\
(c) 
\f2\i Initial costs. 
\f1\i0 Initial costs, including starting load and preparatory costs, are allowable as follows:\
(1) Starting load costs not fully absorbed because of termination are nonrecurring labor, material, and related overhead\

\fs20 (iii) Training; and\
(iv) Lack of familiarity or experience with the product, materials, or manufacturing processes.\

initial plant rearrangement and alterations, management and personnel organization, and production planning. They do not include special machinery and equipment and starting load costs.\
(3) When initial costs are included in the settlement proposal as a direct charge, such costs shall not also be included in overhead. Initial costs attributable to only one contract shall not be allocated to other contracts.\
(4) If initial costs are claimed and have not been segregated on the contractor\'92s books, they shall be segregated for settlement purposes from cost reports and schedules reflecting that high unit cost incurred during the early stages of the contract.\
(5) If the settlement proposal is on the inventory basis, initial costs should normally be allocated on the basis of total end items called for by the contract immediately before termination; however, if the contract includes end items of a diverse nature, some other equitable basis may be used, such as machine or labor hours.\
(d) 
\f2\i Loss of useful value.

(e) 
\f2\i Rental under unexpired leases. 
\f1\i0 Rental costs under unexpired leases, less the residual value of such leases, are generally allowable when shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated contract, if-\
(1) The amount of rental claimed does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the contract and such further period as may be reasonable; and\
(2) The contractor makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of such lease. (f) 
\f2\i Alterations of leased property. 
\f1\i0 The cost of alterations and reasonable restorations required by the lease may be allowed\
when the alterations were necessary for performing the contract.\
(g) Settlement expenses. (1) Settlement expenses, including the following, are generally allowable:\
(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably necessary for-\
(A) The preparation and presentation, including supporting data, of settlement claims to the contracting officer;\

(2) If settlement expenses are significant, a cost account or work order shall be established to separately identify and\
accumulate them.\
(h) 
\f2\i Subcontractor claims. 
\f1\i0 Subcontractor claims, including the allocable portion of the claims common to the contract and\
to other work of the contractor, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the contractor\'92s indirect expense may be allocated to the amount of settlements with subcontractors; provided, that the amount allocated is reasonably proportionate to the relative benefits received and is otherwise consistent with \cf3 31.201-4 \cf4 and \cf3 31.203\cf4 (d). The indirect expense so allocated shall exclude the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses.\

(a) Memberships in trade, business, technical, and professional organizations.\

(3) In special or unusual situations, actual costs in excess of the above-referenced maximum per diem rates are allowable provided that such amounts do not exceed the higher amounts authorized for Federal civilian employees as permitted in the regulations referenced in (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. For such higher amounts to be allowable, all of the following conditions must be met:\
(i) One of the conditions warranting approval of the actual expense method, as set forth in the regulations referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, must exist.\
(ii) A written justification for use of the higher amounts must be approved by an officer of the contractor\'92s organization or designee to ensure that the authority is properly administered and controlled to prevent abuse.\
(iii) If it becomes necessary to exercise the authority to use the higher actual expense method repetitively or on a continuing basis in a particular area, the contractor must obtain advance approval from the contracting officer.\
(iv) Documentation to support actual costs incurred shall be in accordance with the contractor\'92s established practices, subject to paragraph (a)(7) of this section, and provided that a receipt is required for each expenditure of $75.00 or more. The approved justification required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section must be retained.\
(4) Paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section do not incorporate the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section in their entirety. Only the maximum per diem rates, the definitions of lodging, meals, and incidental expenses, and the regulatory coverage dealing with special or unusual situations are incorporated herein.\
(5) An advance agreement (see \cf3 31.109\cf4 ) with respect to compliance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this subsection may be useful and desirable.\
(6) The maximum per diem rates referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection generally would not constitute a reasonable daily charge-\
(i) When no lodging costs are incurred; and/or\
(ii) On partial travel days (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 day of departure and return).\
Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem rates would normally be required under these\
circumstances. While these adjustments need not be calculated in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation or Joint Travel Regulations, they must result in a reasonable charge.\
(7) Costs shall be allowable only if the following information is documented-\
(i) Date and place (city, town, or other similar designation) of the expenses;\
(ii) Purpose of the trip; and\
(iii) Name of person on trip and that person\'92s title or relationship to the contractor.\
(b) Airfare costs in excess of the lowest priced airfare available to the contractor during normal business hours are unallowable except when such accommodations require circuitous routing, require travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolong travel, result in increased cost that would offset transportation savings, are not reasonably adequate for the physical or medical needs of the traveler, or are not reasonably available to meet mission requirements. However, in order for airfare costs in excess of the above airfare to be allowable, the applicable condition(s) set forth above must be documented and justified.\
(c) (1) "Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft," as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs.\
(2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the allowable airfare described in paragraph (b) of this section for the flight destination unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for justifying higher than allowable airfare listed in paragraph (b) of this section are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph (c)(3) of this section has been executed. In all cases, travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall indicate-\
(i) Date, time, and points of departure;\
(ii) Destination, date, and time of arrival;\
(iii) Name of each passenger and relationship to the contractor;\

(3) Where an advance agreement is proposed (see \cf3 31.109\cf4 ), consideration may be given to the following:\
(i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently.\
(ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh additional travel costs.\
(d) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used for company business.

to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is compensation for personal services and is unallowable as stated in \cf3 31.205-6\cf4 (m)(2).\

\fs20 31.701 Purpose.\

\f1\b0 This subpart provides the principles for determining the cost applicable to work performed by nonprofit organizations under contracts with the Government. A nonprofit organization, for purpose of identification, is defined as a business entity organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, of which no part of the net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, of which no substantial part of the activities is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation or participating in any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office, and which are exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.\

\f0\b 31.702 General.\

\f1\b0 The OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix IV, sets forth principles for determining the costs applicable to work performed by nonprofit organizations (as defined in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200) under contracts (as well as grants and other agreements) with the Government. See \cf3 31.108 \cf4 for exceptions to the cost principles for nonprofit organizations.\

\f0\b 31.703 Requirements.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contracts which refer to this \cf3 subpart 31.7 \cf4 for determining allowable costs shall be deemed to refer to, and shall have the allowability of costs determined by the contracting officer in accordance with, the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix IV in effect on the date of the contract.\
(b) Agencies are not expected to place additional restrictions on individual items of cost. However, under \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3744 \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.4304\cf4 , the costs cited in \cf3 31.603\cf4 (b) are unallowable.\

\f2\i i.e
\f1\i0 ., not subject to the interest penalty provisions\
of the Prompt Payment Act in accordance with \cf3 subpart 32.9\cf4 ). A commercial interim payment is given to the contractor after some work has been done, whereas a commercial advance payment is given to the contractor when no work has been done.\

\f2\i Contract action 
\f1\i0 means an action resulting in a contract, as defined in \cf3 subpart 2.1\cf4 , including actions for additional supplies or services outside the existing contract scope, but not including actions that are within the scope and under the terms of the existing contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.\

\f0\b 32.002 Applicability of subparts.\

\f1\b0 (a) The following sections and subparts of this part are applicable to all purchases subject to \cf3 part 32\cf4 : (1) Sections \cf3 32.000 \cf4 through \cf3 32.009\cf4 .\
(2) \cf3 subpart 32.3\cf4 , Loan Guarantees for Defense Production.\

(6) \cf3 subpart 32.9\cf4 , Prompt Payment.\
(7) \cf3 subpart 32.11\cf4 , Electronic Funds Transfer.\
(b) \cf3 subpart 32.2\cf4 , Commercial Product and Commercial Service Purchase Financing, is applicable only to purchases of commercial products and commercial services under authority of \cf3 part 12\cf4 .\

\f1\b0 Unless agency regulations otherwise permit, contract financing shall not be provided for purchases made under the authority of \cf3 part 13\cf4 .\

\f0\b 32.004 Contract performance in foreign countries.\

\f1\b0 The enforceability of contract provisions for security of Government financing in a foreign jurisdiction is dependent upon local law and procedure. Prior to providing contract financing where foreign jurisdictions may become involved, the contracting officer shall ensure the Government\'92s security is enforceable. This may require the provision of additional or different security than that normally provided for in the standard contract clauses.\

\f0\b 32.005 Consideration for contract financing.\

\f1\b0 (a) 
\f2\i Requirement. 
\f1\i0 When a contract financing clause is included at the inception of a contract, there shall be no separate consideration for the contract financing clause. The value of the contract financing to the contractor is expected to be reflected in either (1)a bid or negotiated price that will be lower than such price would have been in the absence of the contract financing, or (2) contract terms and conditions, other than price, that are more beneficial to the Government than they would have been in the absence of the contract financing. Adequate new consideration is required for changes to, or the addition of, contract financing after award.\
               -2\

\f0\b \cf2 32.006-4\
 
\f1\b0 (b) 
\f2\i Amount of new consideration. 
\f1\i0 The contractor may provide new consideration by monetary or nonmonetary means, provided the value is adequate. The fair and reasonable consideration should approximate the amount by which the price would have been less had the contract financing terms been contained in the initial contract. In the absence of definite information on this point, the contracting officer should apply the following criteria in evaluating whether the proposed new consideration is adequate:\
(1) The value to the contractor of the anticipated amount and duration of the contract financing at the imputed financial costs of the equivalent working capital.\
(2) The estimated profit rate to be earned through contract performance.\
(c) 
\f2\i Interest. 
\f1\i0 Except as provided in \cf3 subpart 32.4\cf4 , Advance Payments for Other Than Commercial Acquisitions, the contract\
shall not provide for any other type of specific charges, such as interest, for contract financing.\

\f0\b 32.006 Reduction or suspension of contract payments upon finding of fraud.\
32.006-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) Under \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3806(j)\cf4 , the statutory authority implemented by this section is available to the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; this statutory authority is not available to the United States Coast Guard.

(b) \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3806(c) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C. 4506 \cf4 provide for a reduction or suspension of further payments to a contractor when the agency head determines there is substantial evidence that the contractor's request for advance, partial, or progress payments is based on fraud. This authority does not apply to commercial interim payments under \cf3 subpart 32.2\cf4 , or performance-based payments under \cf3 subpart 32.10\cf4 .\
(c) The agency head may not delegate his or her responsibilities under these statutes below Level IV of the Executive Schedule.\
(d) Authority to reduce or suspend payments under these statutes is in addition to other Government rights, remedies, and procedures.\
(e) In accordance with these statutes, agency head determinations and decisions under this section may be made for an individual contract or any group of contracts affected by the fraud.\

\f0\b 32.006-2 Definition.\

\f2\i\b0 Remedy coordination official
\f1\i0 , as used in this section, means the person or entity in the agency who coordinates within that agency the administration of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies resulting from investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. (See \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3806(a) \cf4 and \cf3 41 U.S.C.4506(a)\cf4 .)\

\f0\b 32.006-3 Responsibilities.\

\f1\b0 (a) Agencies shall establish appropriate procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this section.\
(b) Government personnel shall report suspected fraud related to advance, partial, or progress payments in accordance with agency regulations.\

\f0\b 32.006-4 Procedures.\

\f1\b0 (a) In any case in which an agency\'92s remedy coordination official finds substantial evidence that a contractor\'92s request for advance, partial, or progress payments under a contract awarded by that agency is based on fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that the agency head reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor. The remedy coordination official shall submit to the agency head a written report setting forth the remedy coordination official\'92s findings that support each recommendation.\
(b) Upon receiving a recommendation from the remedy coordination official under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the agency head shall determine whether substantial evidence exists that the request for payment under a contract is based on fraud.\

32.009-1 General.\

\f1\b0 (a) (1) Pursuant to \cf3 31 U.S.C. 3903(a)\cf4 , agencies other than the Department of Defense (DoD) shall provide accelerated payments, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation, if a specific payment date is not established by contract, to\'97\
(i) Small business contractors; and\
(ii) Prime contractors that subcontract with a small business concern, if the prime contractor agrees to make payments to the small business subcontractor within 15 days of receiving the accelerated payment from the Government, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor, to the maximum extent practicable, without any further consideration from or fees charged to the subcontractor.\
(2) Pursuant to \cf3 10 U.S.C. 3801(b)\cf4 , DoD shall provide accelerated payments, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation, to\'97\
(i) Small business contractors; and\
(ii) Prime contractors that subcontract with a small business concern, if the prime contractor agrees to make payments to the small business subcontractor within 15 days of receiving the accelerated payment from the Government, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor, to the maximum extent practicable, without any further consideration from or fees charged to the subcontractor.\
(b) This acceleration does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act and does not affect the application of the Prompt Payment Act late payment interest provisions.\
(c) Agencies may use the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment (see \cf3 32.1108\cf4 ) to facilitate accelerated payment, to earn refunds, and to reduce invoice processing costs.\

\f0\b\fs24 Subpart 32.1 - Financing for Other Than a Commercial Purchase\

\fs20 32.100 Scope of subpart.\

\f1\b0 This subpart provides policies and procedures applicable to contract financing and payment for any purchases other than purchases of commercial products or commercial services in accordance with \cf3 part 12\cf4 .\

\f0\b 32.101 Authority.\

\f1\b0 The basic authority for the contract financing described in this part is contained in \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 45\cf4 , Contract Financing, 10 U.S.C. chapter 277, and TitleIII of the Defense Production Act of l950 (\cf3 50 U.S.C. App.2091\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 32.102 Description of contract financing methods.\

\f1\b0 (a) Advance payments are advances of money by the Government to a prime contractor before, in anticipation of, and for the purpose of complete performance under one or more contracts. They are expected to be liquidated from payments due to the contractor incident to performance of the contracts. Since they are not measured by performance, they differ from partial, progress, or other payments based on the performance or partial performance of a contract. Advance payments may be made to prime contractors for the purpose of making advances to subcontractors.\
(b) Progress payments based on costs are made on the basis of costs incurred by the contractor as work progresses under the contract. This form of contract financing does not include-\
(1) Payments based on the percentage or stage of completion accomplished; (2) Payments for partial deliveries accepted by the Government;\
(3) Partial payments for a contract termination proposal; or\
      32.1-5\

\fs16 EDERAL 
\fs20 A
\fs16 CQUISITION 
\fs20 R
\fs16 EGULATION\
 
\fs20 (4) Performance-based payments.\
(c) Loan guarantees are made by Federal Reserve banks, on behalf of designated guaranteeing agencies, to enable\
contractors to obtain financing from private sources under contracts for the acquisition of supplies or services for the national defense.\
(d) Payments for accepted supplies and services that are only a part of the contract requirements (
\f2\i i.e., 
\f1\i0 partial deliveries) are authorized under \cf3 41 U.S.C. chapter 45 \cf4 and 10 U.S.C. chapter 277. In accordance with 5 CFR 1315.4(k), agencies must pay for partial delivery of supplies or partial performance of services unless specifically prohibited by the contract. Although payments for partial deliveries generally are treated as a method of payment and not as a method of contract financing, using partial delivery payments can assist contractors to participate in contracts without, or with minimal, contract financing. When appropriate, contract statements of work and pricing arrangements must permit acceptance and payment for discrete portions of the work, as soon as accepted (see \cf3 32.906\cf4 (c)).\
(e) (1) Progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion are authorized by the statutes cited in \cf3 32.101\cf4 . (2) This type of progress payment may be used as a payment method under agency procedures. Agency procedures\
must ensure that payments are commensurate with work accomplished, which meets the quality standards established under the contract. Furthermore, progress payments may not exceed 80 percent of the eligible costs of work accomplished on undefinitized contract actions.\
(f) Performance-based payments are contract financing payments made on the basis of- (1) Performance measured by objective, quantifiable methods;\
(2) Accomplishment of defined events; or\
(3) Other quantifiable measures of results.\

\f0\b 32.103 Progress payments under construction contracts.\

\f1\b0 When satisfactory progress has not been achieved by a contractor during any period for which a progress payment is to be made, a percentage of the progress payment may be retained. Retainage should not be used as a substitute for good contract management, and the contracting officer should not withhold funds without cause. Determinations to retain and the specific amount to be withheld shall be made by the contracting officers on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions will be based on the contracting officer\'92s assessment of past performance and the likelihood that such performance will continue. The amount of retainage withheld shall not exceed 10 percent of the approved estimated amount in accordance with the terms of the contract and may be adjusted as the contract approaches completion to recognize better than expected performance, the ability to rely on alternative safeguards, and other factors. Upon completion of all contract requirements, retained amounts shall be paid promptly.\

\f0\b 32.104 Providing contract financing.\

\f1\b0 (a) Prudent contract financing can be a useful working tool in Government acquisition by expediting the performance of essential contracts. Contracting officers must consider the criteria in this part in determining whether to include contract financing in solicitations and contracts. Resolve reasonable doubts by including contract financing in the solicitation. The contracting officer must-\
(1) Provide Government financing only to the extent actually needed for prompt and efficient performance, considering the availability of private financing and the probable impact on working capital of the predelivery expenditures and production lead-times associated with the contract, or groups of contracts or orders (
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 issued under indefinite-delivery contracts, basic ordering agreements, or their equivalent);\
(2) Administer contract financing so as to aid, not impede, the acquisition;\
(3) Avoid any undue risk of monetary loss to the Government through the financing;\
(4) Include the form of contract financing deemed to be in the Government\'92s best interest in the solicitation (see \cf3 32.106\
\cf4 and \cf3 32.113\cf4 ); and\
(5) Monitor the contractor\'92s use of the contract financing provided and the contractor\'92s financial status.\
(b) If the contractor is a small business concern, the contracting officer must give special attention to meeting the contractor\'92s contract financing need. However, a contractor\'92s receipt of a certificate of competency from the Small Business Administration has no bearing on the contractor\'92s need for or entitlement to contract financing.\
(c) Subject to specific agency regulations and paragraph (d) of this section, the contracting officer- (1) May provide customary contract financing in accordance with \cf3 32.113\cf4 ; and\
(2) Must not provide unusual contract financing except as authorized in \cf3 32.114\cf4 .\

\f1\b0 (d) Unless otherwise authorized by agency procedures, the contracting officer may provide contract financing in the form of performance-based payments (see \cf3 subpart 32.10\cf4 ) or customary progress payments (see \cf3 subpart 32.5\cf4 ) if the following conditions are met:\
(1) The contractor-\
(i) Will not be able to bill for the first delivery of products for a substantial time after work must begin (normally\
4 months or more for small business concerns, and 6 months or more for others), and will make expenditures for contract performance during the predelivery period that have a significant impact on the contractor\'92s working capital; or\
(ii) Demonstrates actual financial need or the unavailability of private financing. (2) If the contractor is not a small business concern-\
(i) For an individual contract, the contract price is $3 million or more; or\
(ii) For an indefinite-delivery contract, a basic ordering agreement or a similar ordering instrument, the contracting officer expects the aggregate value of orders or contracts that individually exceed the simplified acquisition threshold to have a total value of $3 million or more. The contracting officer must limit financing to those orders or contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\
(3) If the contractor is a small business concern-\
(i) For an individual contract, the contract price exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold; or\
(ii) For an indefinite-delivery contract, a basic ordering agreement or a similar ordering instrument, the contracting\
officer expects the aggregate value of orders or contracts to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\

\f0\b 32.105 Uses of contract financing.\

\f1\b0 (a) Contract financing methods covered in this part are intended to be self-liquidating through contract performance. Consequently, agencies shall only use the methods for financing of contractor working capital, not for the expansion of contractor-owned facilities or the acquisition of fixed assets. However, under loan guarantees, exceptions may be made for-\
(1) Facilities expansion of a minor or incidental nature, if a relatively small part of the guaranteed loan is used for the expansion and the contractor\'92s repayment would not be delayed or impaired; or\
(2) Other instances of facilities expansion for which contract financing is appropriate under agency procedures. (b) The limitations in this section do not apply to contracts under which facilities are being acquired for Government\
ownership.\

\f0\b 32.106 Order of preference.\

\f1\b0 The contracting officer must consider the following order of preference when a contractor requests contract financing, unless an exception would be in the Government\'92s best interest in a specific case:\
(a) Private financing without Government guarantee. It is not intended, however, that the contracting officer require the contractor to obtain private financing-\
(1) At unreasonable terms; or\
(2) From other agencies.\
(b) Customary contract financing other than loan guarantees and certain advance payments (see \cf3 32.113\cf4 ). (c) Loan guarantees.\
(d) Unusual contract financing (see \cf3 32.114\cf4 ).\
(e) Advance payments (see exceptions in \cf3 32.402\cf4 (b)).\

\f0\b 32.107 Need for contract financing not a deterrent.\

\f1\b0 (a) If the contractor or offeror meets the standards prescribed for responsible prospective contractors at \cf3 9.104\cf4 , the contracting officer shall not treat the contractor\'92s need for contract financing as a handicap for a contract award; 
\f2\i e.g., 
\f1\i0 as a responsibility factor or evaluation criterion.\
(b) The contractor should not be disqualified from contract financing solely because the contractor failed to indicate a need for contract financing before the contract was awarded.\

\f0\b 32.108 Financial consultation.\

\f1\b0 Each contracting office should have available and use the services of contract financing personnel competent to evaluate credit and financial problems. In resolving any questions concerning-\
(a) The financial capability of an offeror or contractor to perform a contract, or\

\fs20 (b) What form of contract financing is appropriate in a given case, the contracting officer should consult the appropriate\
contract financing office.\

\f0\b 32.109 Termination financing.\

\f1\b0 To encourage contractors to invest their own funds in performance despite the susceptibility of the contract to termination for the convenience of the Government, the contract financing procedures under this part may be applied to the financing of terminations either in connection with or independently of financing for contract performance (see \cf3 49.112-1\cf4 ).\

\f0\b 32.110 Payment of subcontractors under cost-reimbursement prime contracts.\

\f1\b0 If the contractor makes financing payments to a subcontractor under a cost-reimbursement prime contract, the contracting officer should accept the financing payments as reimbursable costs of the prime contract only under the following conditions:\
(a) The payments are made under the criteria in \cf3 subpart 32.5 \cf4 for customary progress payments based on costs, \cf3 32.202-1 \cf4 for commercial product or commercial service purchase financing, or \cf3 32.1003 \cf4 for performance-based payments, as applicable.\
(b) If customary progress payments are made, the payments do not exceed the progress payment rate in \cf3 32.501-1\cf4 , unless unusual progress payments to the subcontractor have been approved in accordance with \cf3 32.501-2\cf4 .\
(c) If customary progress payments are made, the subcontractor complies with the liquidation principles of \cf3 32.503-8\cf4 , \cf3 32.503-9\cf4 , and \cf3 32.503-10\cf4 .\
(d) If performance-based payments are made, the subcontractor complies with the liquidation principles of \cf3 32.1004\cf4 (d). (e) The subcontract contains financing payments terms as prescribed in this part.\

\f0\b 32.111 Contract clauses for non-commercial purchases.\

\f1\b0 (a) The contracting officer shall insert the following clauses, appropriately modified with respect to payment due dates, in accordance with agency regulations-\
(1) The clause at \cf3 52.232-1\cf4 , Payments, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price supply contract, a fixed-price service contract, or a contract for nonregulated communication services is contemplated;\
(2) The clause at \cf3 52.232-2\cf4 , Payment under Fixed-Price Research and Development Contracts, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price research and development contract is contemplated;\

(7) The clause at \cf3 52.232-7\cf4 , Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, in solicitations and contracts when a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated. If the contracting officer determines that it is necessary to withhold payment to protect the Government\'92s interests, paragraph (a)(7) of the clause permits the contracting officer to unilaterally issue a modification requiring the contractor to withhold 5 percent of amounts due, up to a maximum of $50,000 under the contract. The contracting officer shall ensure that the modification specifies the percentage and total amount of the withhold payment. Normally, there should be no need to withhold payment for a contractor with a record\
of timely submittal of the release discharging the Government from all liabilities, obligations, and claims, as required by paragraph (g) of the clause.\
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the following clauses, appropriately modified with respect to payment due dates in accordance with agency regulations:\
(1) The clause at \cf3 52.232-8\cf4 , Discounts for Prompt Payment, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price supply contract or fixed-price service contract is contemplated.\
(2) A clause, substantially the same as the clause at \cf3 52.232-9\cf4 , Limitation on Withholding of Payments, in solicitations and contracts when a supply contract, research and development contract, service contract, time-and-materials contract,\
or labor-hour contract is contemplated that includes two or more terms authorizing the temporary withholding of amounts otherwise payable to the contractor for supplies delivered or services performed.\
